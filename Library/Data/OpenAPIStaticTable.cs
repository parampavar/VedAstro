Aryabhata has the following to say about combustion When the Moon has no latitude i.e. when it is at zero degree of latitude it is visible when situated at a distance of 12 degrees from the Sun. Venus is visible when 9 degrees distant from the Sun. The other planets taken in the order of decreasing sizes viz. Jupiter Mercury Saturn and Mars are visible when they are 9 degrees increased by twos i.e. when they are 11 13 15 and 17 degrees distant from the Sun. The degrees as mentioned above are generally taken as the limits within which the respective planets are said to be combust. ",""),
