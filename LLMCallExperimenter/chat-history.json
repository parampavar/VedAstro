  "Message": "It looks like the issue is in the `InitializeChatHistoryFile` method. This method is intended to create a new chat history file if it doesn't exist, but it currently overrides the existing file. To fix this, you can modify the method to check if the file exists before creating it. Here's an updated version of the `InitializeChatHistoryFile` method:\n\n```csharp\nstatic async Task InitializeChatHistoryFile()\n{\n    try\n    {\n        if (!File.Exists(chatHistoryFilePath))\n        {\n            using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(chatHistoryFilePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.ReadWrite))\n            {\n                // Create an empty file\n                await fs.DisposeAsync();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Error initializing chat history file: {ex.Message}\"); // Handle initialization error\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith this change, the method will only create a new file if it doesn't exist. If the file already exists, it will be left untouched, and the program will append new chat messages to the existing file."
