                <h3>Marriage Karma</h3>
                <p>In each life, the probability for marriage comes and goes multiple times. During the high period, your mind and environment around you will be geared towards romance and marriage. When this happens, you will be attracted to people for partnership, even if they are not in-tune.</p>
                <p>If this "marriage karma" lasted forever, there would be no problem. You can even marry your enemy, and you will not fight. But in reality, this period ends, so that next periods can come. When this happens, if your "life partner" is not in-tune with you, then comes the fights, broken hearts, and divorces. This is how bad marriages are made.</p>

                <h3>Imagine Perfect Marriages</h3>
                <p>Do we need more proof? Is it not high time, for us as a human species to stop hunting for partners blindly like animals based on our senses and circumstances. But rather use intelligence guided by cosmic laws that guarantee a perfect union.</p>
                <p>The age of "imperfection", the age of "Kali" is over. We have before us a new age of thinking men, the age of "Dwarpara". Gone are the ways of old. Just imagine a world with no divorces, a world where happy marriages is a common sight. Where laughter abounds & fear stands still.</p>
