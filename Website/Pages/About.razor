        <DropCap Alphabet="A" />nybody who has studied Vedic Astrology knows well how accurate it can be.
        But also how complex it can get to make accurate predictions.
        It takes decades of experience to be able make accurate prediction.
        Thus this knowledge only reaches a limited people.

    <SubArticleBlock Title="Goal">
        Our goal is to make Vedic Astrology easily accessible to anybody.
        So that people can use it in their daily lives for their benefit.
        Vedic Astrology in Sanskrit means <strong>"Light"</strong> and that is exactly what it is.
        It lights our future so we can change it. And it lights our past, to understand our mistakes.
    </SubArticleBlock>
    <SubArticleBlock Title="How">
        Using modern computational technologies &amp; methods we can <strong>simplify the complexity</strong> of Vedic Astrology.
        For example, calculating planet strength (Bhava Bala) used to take hours, now with computers we can calculate it in
        <strong>milliseconds</strong>. Combining databases &amp; innovative programming methods. There's no need to remember thousands of planetary combinations,
        allowing you to make <strong>accurate predictions</strong> with little to no knowledge.

            The first line of code for this project was written in late <strong>2014</strong> at Itä-Pasila. Back then it was a simple desktop software,
            with no UI and only text display. With continued support from users, this project has steadily developed to what it is today.
            Helping people from all over the world.

                It is told in the stories of old, that a heathen god moved by the plight of a
                child. Gave onto him the knowledge of the stars as compensation for the tears.
                The child in turn passed that gift to every soul he knew,
                with no check on price or pedigree. And so astrology was born.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                As such this knowledge stands as an opportunity for every soul to realize that even though
                we play a role in the world, we are not made of it. That we are <strong>souls</strong> first!
                And the planets do no have a say on it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 150px;">
                A means of escape from the thraldom of cosmic illusion, is what it really is.
                And so for this reason the masters have continued to bring this out in every age.
                <br />
                It's their gift to us, the <strong>"world folk"</strong>.
