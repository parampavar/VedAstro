Ramayana. Sage Vashishta had 100 sons.  All of them were killed by a  \nRakshasa influenced by Sage Vishwamitra. Sage Vashita could not retaliate as he was a Brahma Rishi who has conquered anger. In grief  \nhe tired to do suicide. After failing to end his life by many methods he came back home sadly. He heard a small voice telling the Vedas.  \nThere he found his eldest son Shakti\u2019s wife Adrisyanti. His daughter-in-law was pregnant and the small child inside her was chanting the  \nVedas. Parasara was born to Shakti posthumously. He performed a great sacrifice to destroy the Rakshasas, for a Rakshasa had killed his  \nfather. He became a Maha Rishi expert in astrology. The word Parasara means the vivifier of the dead.\n \nOnce, while crossing a river, he calculated that a great person could be born now. He expressed his desire to the ferry girl, but she was  \nreluctant. He convinced her that no blame would attach to her and that she would regain her virginity after the act. At last she consented, on  \nthe condition that the odor of fish that clung to her (for she had been born inside a fish), be changed to fragnance. This girl was none other  \nthan Satyavati, who was later married to King Shantanu. \n \nThey were united in an islet in the middle of the river. This act was hidden from the prying eyes of the world, with the aid of a mist, created by the yogic powers of  \nParasara. A son was born immediately to her. Since this was a divine birth, the child grew to adulthood in minutes and after promising his mother that he would  \nreturn whenver she had a need for him, left to study the scriptures with his father. This child was Vyasa, who later composed the Mahabharata. Since he was dark  \nand born in an island he is also known as Krishna(dark)-Dwaipayana (born in an island). Sage Vyas\u2019s son is Sukha Brahma Rishi.\n \nCh. 1. The Creation \n \nI prostrate before the lotus-feet of Lord Vighneswara, offspring of Uma, the cause of destruction of sorrow, who is served by Mahabhutas (the five great elements of  \nthe universe) etc., who has the face of a tusker and who consumes the essence of Kapittha and Jambu fruits. 1-4. Offering his obeisance to all-knowing Maharishi  \nParasar and with folded hands, Maitreya said: \u201cO venerable Maharishi, Jyotish, the supreme limb of the Vedas, has three divisions, viz. Hora, Ganita and Samhita.  \nAmong the said three divisions Hora, or the general part of Jyotish is still more excellent. I desire to know of its glorious aspects from you. Be pleased to tell me,  \nhow this Universe is created? How does it end? What is the relationship of the animals, born on this earth, with the heavenly bodies? Please speak elaborately\u201d 5-\n8. Maharishi Parasar answered. O Brahmin, your query has an auspicious purpose in it for the welfare of the Universe. Praying Lord Brahma and Sri Sarasvati, his  \npower (and consort) and Surya, the leader of the Grahas and the cause of Creation, I shall proceed to narrate to you the science of Jyotish, as heard through Lord  \nBrahma. Only good will follow the teaching of this Vedic Science to the students, who are peacefully disposed, who honour the preceptors (and elders), who speak  \nonly truth and are godfearing. Woeful forever, doubtlessly, will it be to impart knowledge of this science to an unwilling student, to a heterodox and to a crafty  \nperson. 9-12.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "846d3b3f-25f1-43ed-80fb-2a4191b209f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "846d3b3f-25f1-43ed-80fb-2a4191b209f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53a57a31-7e89-4402-a82e-6748ce8b2be6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b31c0223a6db16d5f385c66ad0da99b8118c5380754d47a46aa84fc904c53d38"}, "2": {"node_id": "45710ef0-4650-4260-a385-7c8993251c20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "4ae0d055c8791a12810c05b23b11381019430b25e5aaebdd24ba2afcb96cf779"}, "3": {"node_id": "222f1134-d839-4028-93ed-a1b8899267fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "add87c6b2e5833d881d9367a9a07a7ca0182913248ec8af80a7b542d2bfde25e"}}, "hash": "930d9a6d35368f2bbfb57b1a306d18c64f55f7dbaaf4391649ff67eae80d7279", "text": "9-12.

The three powers are Sri Shakti (Mother Lakshmi) with Sattva-Gun, Bhu Shakti (Mother-Earth) with Rajo-Gun and Nil Shakti with Tamo-Gun. Apart  \nfrom the three, the fourth kind of Vishnu, influenced by Sri Shakti and Bhoo Shakti, assumes the form of Shankarshan with Tamo-Gun, of Pradyumna with Rajo-\nGun and of Anirudh with Sattva-Gun. 16-17. Mahatatwa, Ahamkar and Ahamkar Murti and Brahma, are born from Shankarshan, Pradyumna and Anirudh,  \nrespectively. All these three forms are endowed with all the three Gunas, with predominance of the Gun due to their origin. 18-19. Ahamkar is of three classes, i.e.  \nwith Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic dispositions. Divine class, sensory organs and the five primordial compounds (space, air, fire, water and earth) are, respectively,  \nfrom the said three Ahamkaras. 20. Lord Vishnu, coupled with Sri Shakti, rules over the three worlds. Coupled with Bhoo Shakti, He is Brahma causing the  \nUniverse. Coupled with Neel Shakti, He is Shiva, destroying the Universe. 21-24. The Lord is in all beings and the entire Universe is in Him. All beings contain both  \nJivatma and Paramatmansas. Some have predominance of the former, while yet some have the latter in predominance. Paramatmans is predominant in the  \nGrahas, viz. Surya etc. and Brahma, Shiva and others. Their powers, or consorts too have predominance of Paramatmans. Others have more of Jivatmans. \n \nCh. 2. Great Incarnations \n \n1. Maitreya: \u201cO Maharishi Parasar, are the incarnations of Vishnu, viz. Sri Ram, Sri Krishn etc., endowed with Jivans? 2. Maharishi Parashar: \u201cO Brahmin, the four  \nincarnations, viz. Ram, Krishn, Narasimh and Varah are wholly with Paramatmans. The other incarnations (than these, out of the ten) have in them Jivans too. 3-4.  \nThe unborn Lord has many incarnations. He has incarnated, as the 9 (Nava) Grahas to bestow on the living beings the results due to their Karmas. He is Janardan.  \nHe assumed the auspicious form of Grahas to destroy the demons (evil forces) and sustain the divine beings. 5-7. From Surya the incarnation of Ram, from Candr  \nthat of Krishn, from Mangal that of Narasimh, from Budh that of Buddha, from Guru that of Vaman, from Sukr that of Parashuram, from Sani that of Kurma  \n(Tortoise), from Rahu that of Varah (Pig) and from Ketu that of Meen (Fish) occurred.

Maitreya: \u201cO Maharishi, you have affectionately explained about the incarnations of Grahas. Now kindly detail their characters and dispositions. 2-3. Parasar: \u201cO  \nBrahmin, listen to the account of placement of the heavenly bodies. Out of the many luminous bodies sighted in the skies some are stars, yet some are Grahas.  \nThose, that have no movements, are the Nakshatras (asterisms). 4-6. Those are called \u2018Grahas\u2019, that move through the Nakshatras (or stellar mansions) in the  \nzodiac. The said zodiac comprises of 27 Nakshatras commencing from Ashvini. The same area is divided in 12 parts equal to 12 \u2018Rashis\u2019 commencing from Mesh.  \nThe names of the Grahas commence from Surya. The Rashi rising is known, as \u2018Lagn\u2019. Based on Lagn and the Grahas, joining and departing from each other, the  \nnative\u2019s good and bad effects are deducted. Addition from Santhanam till Sloka 7. The names of the 27 Nakshatras are Ashvini, Bharani, Krittika, Rohini, Mrigasira,  \nArdra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Aslesha, Magha, Purvaphalguni, Uttaraphalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, Vishaka, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Mula, Purvashadh, Uttarashadh,  \nShravana, Dhanishtha, Satabhisha, Purvabhadra, Uttarabhadra, Revati. Lagn is a very important point in the horoscope. It is the Rashi, that rises in the East, on  \nthe latitude of birth. The apparent rising of a Rashi is due to the rotation of the earth on its own axis at a rate of motion, causing every degree of the zodiac", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e54fa9a2-4f05-414e-ba1a-6580ba199cfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e54fa9a2-4f05-414e-ba1a-6580ba199cfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de0c3279-746d-45da-931d-e7a925b2e91c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "42de5331d7160a9fff55bd73422173f33b0309fc32937293c061947f5b1711c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "038a1188-666d-40ce-82b2-95db3220b9fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6db5e04b2a26feebfba300333f374ed8682ed3ca7d31663819beae156d9d9007"}}, "hash": "205f920fdf07adf29bdaad2b0cab987eee6f8f02fc87a6c17786adc8c63fd08c", "text": "seemingly ascend on the eastern horizon. Approximately, two hours are required for a Rashi to pass via the horizon, thereby every degree taking four minutes to  \nascend. This duration, however, is actually dependent on the concerned latitude. Actually Surya has no motion. His motion is an apparent one, as viewed from the  \nrotating earth. Other Grahas, including the nodes, have varied rates of motion. The average daily motions of the Grahas, which are not, however standard, are, as  \nfollows: Surya 1, Candr 13-15, Mangal 30-45\u2019, Budh 65-100\u2019, Sukr 62-82\u2019, Guru 5-15\u2019, Sani 2\u2019, Rahu/Ketu 3\u2019. With such different motions, a Grah forms various  \nDrishtis with others. These Drishtis through longitudinal distances have a great deal of utility in Jyotish. This is what Maharishi Parashar suggests to be considered.  \n7. Details (of astronomical nature) of stars have to be understood by general rules, while I narrate to you about the effects of Grahas and Rashis. 8-9. The positions  \nof the Grahas for a given time be taken, as per Drikganit. And with the help of Rashi durations, applicable to the respective places, Lagn at birth should be known.  \nNow, I tell you about the castes, descriptions and dispositions of the Grahas. 10. Names of Grahas. The names of the nine Grahas, respectively, are Surya, Candr,  \nMangal, Budh, Guru, Sukr, Sani, Rahu and Ketu. 11. Benefics and Malefics. Among these, Surya, Sani, Mangal, decreasing Candr, Rahu and Ketu (the ascending  \nand the descending nodes of Candr) are malefics, while the rest are benefics. Budh, however, is a malefic, if he joins a malefic. Addition from Santhanam till Sloka  \n12-13. When Candr is ahead of Surya, but within 120, she has medium strength. Between 120 to 240 she is very auspicious,( see \u2018Atishubhapred\u2019). From 240 to 0  \nshe is bereft of strength. This is Yavanas\u2019 view, vide P. 70 of my English Translation of Saravali. This view is, however, related to Candr\u2019s strength, or otherwise,  \nwhile waning Candr (Krishna Paksh, dark half) is a malefic and waxing Candr (Shukla Paksh, bright half) is a benefic. Should Candr be Yuti with a benefic, or  \nreceiving a Drishti from a benefic, she turns a benefic, even if in a waning state. As regards Budh, we have clear instructions from Maharishi Parashar, that he  \nbecomes a malefic, if he joins a malefic. If waning Candr and Budh are together, both are benefics. 12-13. Grah governances. Surya is the soul of all. Candr is the  \nmind. Mangal is one\u2019s strength. Budh is speech-giver, while Guru confers Knowledge and happiness. Sukr governs semen (potency), while Sani denotes grief. 14-\n15. Grah cabinet. Of royal status are Surya and Candr, while Mangal is the Army chief. Prince-apparent is Budh. The ministerial Grahas are Guru and Sukr. Sani is  \na servant. Rahu and Ketu form the Grah Army. 16-17. Complexions of Grahas. Surya is blood-red. Candr is tawny. Mangal, who is not very tall is blood-red, while  \nBudh\u2019s hue is akin to that of green grass. Tawny, variegated and dark are Guru, Sukr and Sani in their order. 18. Deities of Grahas.

Lead and blue gem belong to Rahu and Ketu.  \nSurya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Sukr and Sani in their order govern red silken, white silken, red, black silken, saffron, silken and multi-coloured robes. 45-46.  \nSeasons of Grahas. Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsh, Sarad, Hemanta and Sisir are the six Ritus (or seasons), respectively, governed by Sukr, Mangal, Candr, Budh,  \nGuru and Sani. Rahu and Ketu denote 8 months and 3 months, respectively. 47. Dhatu, Mool and Jiva Divisions. Dhatu Grahas are Rahu, Mangal, Sani and Candr,  \nwhile Surya and Sukr are Mula Grahas. Budh, Guru and Ketu rule Jivas. 48. Age. Out of all the Grahas Sani is the eldest. He bestows maximum number of years in  \nNaisargik Dasha. 49-50. Exaltation and Debilitation. For the seven Grahas, from Surya on, the exaltation Rashis are, respectively, Mesh, Vrishabh, Makar, Kanya,  \nKark, Meen and Tula. The deepest exaltation degrees are, respectively, 10, 3, 28, 15, 5, 27 and 20 in those Rashis. And in the seventh Rashi from the said  \nexaltation Rashi each Grah has its own debilitation. The same degrees of deep exaltation apply to deep fall. 51-54. Additional Dignities. In Simh the first 20 degrees  \nare Surya\u2019s Mooltrikon, while the rest is his own Bhava. After the first 3 degrees of exaltation portion in Vrishabh, for Candr, the rest is her Mooltrikon. Mangal has  \nthe first 12 degrees in Mesh, as Mooltrikon with the rest therein becoming simply his own Bhava. For Budh, in Kanya the first 15 degrees are exaltation zone, the  \nnext 5 degrees Mooltrikon and the last 10 degrees are own Bhava. The first one third of Dhanu is the Mooltrikon of Guru, while the remaining part thereof is his own  \nBhava. Sukr divides Tula into two halves keeping the first, as Mooltrikon and the second, as own Bhava. Sani\u2019s arrangements are same in Kumbh, as Surya has in  \nSimh. 55. Natural Relationships. Note the Rashis, which are the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 12th from the Mooltrikon of a Grah.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a9722f0-5e27-4bdd-889e-f153f778eec2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a9722f0-5e27-4bdd-889e-f153f778eec2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de0c3279-746d-45da-931d-e7a925b2e91c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "42de5331d7160a9fff55bd73422173f33b0309fc32937293c061947f5b1711c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb9d351a-81e7-427e-982f-029e766e38aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "cdc5f2fdbd9a57973eb32ca95d0334d8a6ac697ebe7550b83951c8ed0a5f51d6"}}, "hash": "5cb81bd077bf39d96338caf0329b5bf80a1ae49ed318d61a2a1d84c9aa221fa1", "text": "The Grahas ruling such Rashis are  \nits friends, apart from the Lord of its exaltation Rashi. Lords other than these are its enemies. If a Grah becomes its friend as well, as its enemy (on account of the  \nsaid two computations), then it is neutral, or equal. 56. Temporary Relationships. The Grah, posited in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, or the 12th from another,  \nbecomes a mutual friend. There is enmity otherwise. (This applies to a given Janm Kundali) 57-58. Compound Relationship. Should two Grahas be naturally and  \ntemporarily friendly, they become extremely friendly. Friendship on one count and neutrality on another count make them friendly. Enmity on one count combined  \nwith affinity on the other turns into equality. Enmity and neutralship cause only enmity. Should there be enmity in both manners, extreme enmity is obtained. The  \nJyotishi should consider these and declare horoscopic effects accordingly. 59-60. Ratio of Effects. A Grah in exaltation gives fully good effects, while in Mooltrikon it  \nis bereft of its auspicious effects by one fourth. It is half beneficial in its own Bhava. Its beneficence is one fourth in a friendly Rashi. In an equal\u2019s Rashi one eighth  \nof auspicious disposition is useful. The good effects are nil in debilitation, or enemy\u2019s camp. Inauspicious effects are quite reverse with reference to what is stated.  \n61-64. Non-luminous UpaGrahas (Sub-Grahas). Add 4 Rashis 13 degrees and 20 minutes of arc to Surya\u2019s longitude at a given moment to get the exact position of  \nthe all inauspicious Dhoom. Reduce Dhoom from 12 Rashis to arrive at Vyatipat. Vyatipat is also inauspicious. Add six Rashis to Vyatipat to know the position of  \nParivesh. He is extremely inauspicious. Deduct Parivesh from 12 Rashis to arrive at the position of Chap (Indra Dhanus), who is also inauspicious. Add 16 degrees  \n40 minutes to Chap, which will give Ketu (UpaKetu), who is a malefic. By adding a Rashi to UpaKetu, you get the original longitude of Surya. These are the Grahas,  \ndevoid of splendour, which are malefics by nature and cause affliction. 65. Effects of Sub-Grahas. If one of these afflicts Surya, the native\u2019s dynasty will decline,  \nwhile Candr and Lagn, respectively, associated with one of these, will destroy the longevity and wisdom.

Here again, the eighth portion is Lord-less, while Sani\u2019s portion is Gulik.

These durations differently apply to different places (commensurate with variable day and night durations). 70. Gulik\u2019s Position.  \nThe degree, ascending at the time of start of Gulik\u2019s portion (as above), will be the longitude of Gulik at a given place. Based on this longitude only, Gulik\u2019s effects  \nfor a particular nativity be estimated. 71-74. Calculation of Pranapad. Convert the given time into Vighatis and divide the same by 15. The resultant Rashi, degrees  \netc. be added to Surya, if he is in a Movable Rashi, which will yield Pranapad. If Surya is in a Fixed Rashi, add 240 degrees additionally and, if in a Dual Rashi, add  \n120 degrees in furtherance to get Pranapad. The birth will be auspicious, if Pranapad falls in the 2nd, 5th, 9th, 4th, 10th, or 11th from the natal Lagn. In other  \nBhavas Pranapad indicates an inauspicious birth. Notes. Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak, Mrityu, Kaal and Gulik are the 5 Kaal Velas, suggested by Maharishi  \nParashar. The day duration, according to altitude, is divided into eight equal parts. The eighth portion is unlorded. The first portion is allotted to the weekday Lord.  \nOther portions follow in the order of weekday Lords. We consider 5 portions of Grahas, ignoring that of Candr and Sukr. The portions of Surya, Mangal, Budh, Guru  \nand Sani are, respectively, called Kaal, Mrityu, Ardhaprahar, Yamaghantak and Gulik. In the case of night the durations, or 1/8th parts are allotted in a different  \norder. The first portion goes to the Grah, ruling the 5th weekday Lord, counted from the day in question. The others follow in the usual order. Here again, the 8th  \npart is Lord-less. The portions of Grahas from Kaal to Gulik are the same in nomenclature in the night also.

Importance of Hora. The word Hora is derived from Ahoratr after dropping the first and last syllables. Thus Hora (Lagnas) remains in between Ahoratr (i.e. day  \nand night) and after knowing Hora the good and bad effects of a native be known. Sri Vishnu, the Invisible is Time personified. His limbs are the 12 Rashis,  \ncommencing from Mesh. 3. Names of Rashis. The 12 Rashis of the zodiac in order are Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar,  \nKumbh and Meen. 4-4\u00bd. Limbs of Kaal Purush.

O excellent of  \nBrahmins, now is a step explained to arrive at the Nishek Lagn, when the natal Lagn is known. Note the angular distance between Sani and Mandi (Gulik). Add this  \nto the difference between the Lagn Bhava (Madhya, or cusp) and the 9th Bhava (cusp). The resultant product in Rashis, degrees etc. will represent the months,  \ndays etc., that elapsed between Nishek and birth. At birth, if Lagn Lord is in the invisible half (i.e. from Lagn cusp to descendental cusp), add the degrees etc.,  \nCandr moved in the particular Rashi, occupied by her, to the above-mentioned product.

Special Lagnas \n \n1. Oh excellent of the Brahmins, I explain below again some special Lagnas, viz. Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn and Ghati Lagn. 2-3. Bhava Lagn. From sunrise to the  \ntime of birth every 5 Ghatis (or 120 minutes) constitute one Bhava Lagn. Divide the time of birth (in Ghatis, Vighatis etc.) from sunrise by 5 and add the quotient etc.  \nto Surya\u2019s longitude, as at sunrise. This is called Bhava Lagn. 4-5. Hora Lagn. Again from sunrise till the time of birth Hora Lagn repeats itself every 2\u00bd Ghatis (i. e.  \n60 minutes). Divide the time past up to birth from sunrise by 2\u00bd and add the quotient etc. in Rashis, degrees and so on to the longitude of Surya, as at the sunrise.  \nThis will yield Hora Lagn in Rashi, degrees etc. 6-8. Ghati Lagn (Ghatik Lagn). Now listen to the method of working out Ghati Lagn. This Lagn changes along with  \nevery Ghati (24 minutes) from the sunrise. Note birth time in Ghatis and Vighatis. Consider the number of Ghatis past, as number of Rashis, or Ghati Lagnas. The  \nVighatis be divided by 2 to arrive at degrees and minutes of arc, past in the said Ghati Lagn. The product so arrived in Rashis, degrees and minutes be added to  \nSurya\u2019s longitude, as at sunrise, to get the exact location of Ghati Lagn. So say Maharishis, like Narada. 9. Use of Special Lagnas. Keeping the Grahas at birth, as  \nit is, prepare various Bhava Kundalis with respect to each special Lagn and analyze, as done for the natal Lagn. 10-13\u00bd. Varnad Dasha. I now detail Varnad  \nDasha, just by knowing which one can deal with the longevity of a native. If the natal Lagn is an odd Rashi, count directly from Mesh to natal Lagn.

Similarly, if the Hora Lagn is an odd one, count from Mesh to Hora Lagn in direct order. If  \nthe Hora Lagn is an even one, count from Meen to Hora Lagn in the reverse order. If both the products are odd Rashis, or even Rashis, then add both the figures. If  \none is odd and the other is even, then know the difference between the two products. If the latest product in this process is an odd one, count so many Rashis from  \nMesh in a direct manner; if an even one, count so many Rashis from Meen in reverse order.

Out of the two, viz. natal Lagn and Hora Lagn, whichever is stronger, from there Varnad starts. If the natal Lagn is an  \nodd Rashi, the counting of Dashas is clockwise, otherwise anticlockwise. Lagn Dasha years will equal the number of Rashis, intervening between the natal Lagn  \nand Varnad. Similarly for other Bhavas. 16-20. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Should a Kon from Lagn\u2019s Varnad be occupied, or drishtied by a malefic, the native will live  \nonly up to the Dasha of the said Rashi. Just, as the Rudra Grah in Sool Dasha is capable of causing evils, the above-mentioned Grahas related to Varnad\u2019s Kon be  \ntreated. The Varnad Lagn be considered, as natal Lagn, while the 7th from Varnad will denote the longevity of the spouse, the 11th longevity of elder brothers and  \nsisters, the 3rd longevity of younger brothers and sisters, the 5th the longevity of sons, the 4th longevity of mother and the 9th longevity of father. The Dasha of the  \nSool Rashi will inflict greater evils. 21-24. Effects of Varnad (cont.). Similar assessments be made with reference to the Varnad of each Bhava, commencing the  \nfirst, and the evils and goods due to a nativity be known. These Varnad Dashas are only for Bhavas (Rashis) and not their occupants. The sub period of each  \nDasha will be one twelfth of the Dasha and the order will also be clockwise, or anti-clockwise, as explained earlier. The natal Lagn is to be calculated according to  \nbirth place, while Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn etc. are common to all places \n \nCh. 6. The Sixteen Divisions of a Rashi \n \n1. O Maharishi Parasar, I have known from you about the Grahas, Rashis and their descriptions. I desire to know the details of various divisions of a Rashi, will you  \nplease narrate. 2-4. Names of the 16 Vargas. Lord Brahma has described 16 kinds of Vargas (Divisions) for each Rashi. Listen to those. The names are Rashi,  \nHora, Dreshkan, Chaturthans,  Saptans,  Navans,  Dashans, Dvadashans,  Shodashans,  Vimshans,  Chaturvimshans, Saptavimshans,  Trimshans, Khavedans,  \nAkshavedans and Shashtians. 5-6. Rashi and Hora. The Rashi, owned by a Grah, is called its Kshetra. The first half of an odd Rashi is the Hora, ruled by Surya.  \nWhile the second half is the Hora of Candr. The reverse is true in the case of an even Rashi. Half of a Rashi is called Hora. These are totally 24, counted from  \nMesh and repeated twice (at the rate of 12) in the whole of the zodiac. 7-8. Dreshkan. One third of a Rashi is called Dreshkan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36c0973e-207f-497c-8814-ba6e3975c8d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "36c0973e-207f-497c-8814-ba6e3975c8d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f18b5fba-0877-4b8b-b6de-7ac7f138bfec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6b1799bd4743d6eb717fc2e3342420caf24aa930030e87bab337c78fa602f3f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "b41647d3-4574-462b-a52c-c20f5a5ddb26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "256b85c76d98a51cd03aa76cbb57e68f0b9cbbbb98672a0c19d90d4ec8dc9708"}, "3": {"node_id": "2621251c-867e-4012-8703-bf347bf103e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "1c6da6f730b1274f84e18b9f1ef5dc844d39cef14b95c87862a0d9db1e0e47ab"}}, "hash": "8f84659d567512469c561b88d594f856d30d8d8306e9f4028b3e14cf170aae4d", "text": "Dreshkan. One third of a Rashi is called Dreshkan. These are totally 36, counted from  \nMesh, repeating thrice at the rate of 12 per round. The 1st, 5th and the 9th Rashis from a Rashi are its three Dreshkanas and are, respectively, lorded by Narada,  \nAgasthya and Durvash. 9. Chaturthans. The Lords of the 4 Kendras from a Rashi are the rulers of respective Chaturthans of a Rashi, commencing from Mesh.  \nEach Chaturthans is one fourth of a Rashi. The deities, respectively, are Sanak, Sanand, Kumar and Sanatan. 10-11. Saptans. The Saptans (one seventh of a  \nRashi) counting commences from the same Rashi in the case of an odd Rashi. It is from the seventh Rashi thereof, while an even Rashi is considered. The names  \nof the seven divisions in odd Rashis are Kshaar Ksheer, Dadhi, Ghrith, Ikshu, Ras, Madhya and Suddh Jal. These designations are reversed for an even Rashi. 12.  \nNavans. The Navans calculation are for a Movable Rashi from there itself, for a Fixed Rashi from the 9th thereof and for a Dual Rashi from the 5th thereof. They go  \nby designations Deva (divine), Manushya (human) and Rakshasa (devilish) in a successive and repetitive order for a Movable Rashi. (Manushya, Rakshasa and  \nDeva are the order for a Fixed Rashi, while Rakshasa, Manushya and Deva are a Dual Rashi\u2019s order) 13-14. Dashans. Starting from the same Rashi for an odd  \nRashi and from the 9th with reference to an even Rashi, the 10 Dashansas, each of 3 degrees, are reckoned. These are presided over by the ten rulers of the  \ncardinal directions, viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Rakshasa, Varuna, Vayu, Kuber, Isan, Brahma and Ananth in case of an odd Rashi. It is in the reverse order, that these  \npresiding deities are reckoned, when an even Rashi is given. 15. Dvadashans. The reckoning of the Dvadashans (one twelfth of a Rashi, or 2\u00bd degrees each)  \ncommences  from the  same  Rashi.  In  each  Rashi the  presidentship  repeats  thrice  in  the  order of  Ganesh,  Ashvini  Kumar,  Yama  and  Sarpa  for the  12  \nDvadashansas. 16. Shodashans (or Kalans). Starting from Mesh for a Movable Rashi, from Simh for a Fixed Rashi and from Dhanu for a Dual Rashi, the 16  \nShodashansas (16th part of a Rashi, i.e. of 1\u00b052\u201930\u201d) are regularly distributed. The presiding deities of these repeat in the order Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Surya  \nfour times in the case of an odd Rashi. It is reverse in the case of an even Rashi, that these ruling deities are understood. 17-21. Vimshans. From Mesh for a  \nMovable Rashi, from Dhanu for a Fixed Rashi and from Simh for a Common Rashi: this is how the calculations of Vimshansas (1/20th of a Rashi, or 1\u00b030\u2019 each) are  \nto commence. The presiding deities of the 20 Vimshansas in an odd Rashi are, respectively: Kali, Gauri, Jaya, Lakshmi, Vijaya, Vimal, Sati, Tara, Jvalamukhi,  \nSveta, Lalita, Bagalamukhi, Pratyangir, Shachi, Raudri, Bhavani, Varad, Jaya, Tripura and Sumukhi.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2621251c-867e-4012-8703-bf347bf103e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2621251c-867e-4012-8703-bf347bf103e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f18b5fba-0877-4b8b-b6de-7ac7f138bfec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6b1799bd4743d6eb717fc2e3342420caf24aa930030e87bab337c78fa602f3f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "36c0973e-207f-497c-8814-ba6e3975c8d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "8f84659d567512469c561b88d594f856d30d8d8306e9f4028b3e14cf170aae4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ae7b48b-a5f3-423d-a29c-1902bde6ad7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "5b87ede651d75899f322b4c39509bb4c9347c6b034696d03283052a1d57912b8"}}, "hash": "1c6da6f730b1274f84e18b9f1ef5dc844d39cef14b95c87862a0d9db1e0e47ab", "text": "In an even Rashi these 20 deities, respectively, are Daya,  \nMegha, Chinnasi, Pisachini, Dhumavathi, Matangi, Bal, Bhadr, Arun, Anal, Pingal, Chuchchuk, Ghora, Vaarahi, Vaishnavi, Sita, Bhuvanesvari, Bhairavi, Mangal  \nand Aparajit. 22-23. Chaturvimshans. The Chaturvimshans (1/24th part of a Rashi, or 1\u00b015\u2019 each) distribution commences from Simh and Kark, respectively, for an  \nodd and an even Rashi. In the case of an odd Rashi the ruling deities repeat twice in the order of Skand, Parusdhar, Anal, Vishwakarma, Bhag, Mitr, Maya, Antaka,  \nVrisha-Dwaja, Govinda, Madan and Bhima. Reverse these from Bhima twice to know the deities for the Chaturvimshans in an even Rashi. 24-26. Saptavimshans  \n(Nakshatrans, or Bhans). The Saptavimshans Lords are, respectively, the presiding deities of the 27 Nakshatras, as under: Dastra (Ashvini Kumar), Yama, Agni,  \nBrahma, Candr, Isa, Adhiti, Jiva, Ahi, Pitar, Bhag, Aryama, Surya, Tvasht, Marut, Chakragni, Mitr, Vasava, Rakshasa, Varuna, Vishwadeva, Govinda, Vasu,  \nVaruna, Ajap, Ahirbuddhnya and Pushya. These are for an odd Rashis. Count these deities in a reverse order for an even Rashi. The Saptavimshans distribution  \ncommences from Mesh and other Movable Rashis for all the 12 Rashis. 27-28. Trimshans. The Trimshans Lords for an odd Rashi are Mangal, Sani, Guru, Budh  \nand Sukr. Each of them in order rules 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5 degrees. The deities, ruling over the Trimshansas, are, respectively, Agni, Vayu, Indra, Kuber and Varuna. In  \nthe case of an even Rashi the quantum of Trimshans, Grah lordship and deities get reversed. 29-30. Khavedans (or Chatvarimshans, 1/40th part of a Rashi). For  \nodd Rashis count from Mesh and for an even Rashi from Tula in respect of Khavedansas (each of 45\u2019 of arc). Vishnu, Candr, Marichi, Tvasht, Dhata, Shiva, Ravi,  \nYama, Yaksh, Gandharv, Kaal and Varuna repeat successively, as presiding deities, in the same order for all Rashis. 31-32. Akshavedans (1/45th part of a Rashi).  \nMesh, Simh and Dhanu are the Rashis, from which the distributions, respectively, commence for Movable, Immovable and Common Rashis. In Movable Rashis  \nBrahma, Shiva and Vishnu; in Immovable Rashis Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma and in Common Rashis Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva repeat 15 times the presidentship  \nover these Akshavedansas. 33-41. Shashtians (1/60th part of a Rashi, or half a degree each). To calculate the Shashtians Lord ignore the Rashi position of a Grah  \nand take the degrees etc. it traversed in that Rashi. Multiply that figure by 2 and divide the degrees by 12. Add 1 to the remainder, which will indicate the Rashi, in  \nwhich the Shashtians falls. The Lord of that Rashi is the Grah, ruling the said Shashtians. In odd Rashis the names of Shashtiansas are 1. Ghora, 2. Rakshasa, 3.  \nDeva, 4. Kuber, 5. Yaksh, 6. Kindar, 7.

Maitreya, explained now are the sum effects of classifications of different divisions (or Vargas, so far narrated). These are four kinds, viz. Shad  \nVarg, Sapth Varg, Dasha Varg and Shodasha Varg. In the ShadVarg classification the Varg designations are Kimshuk, Vyanjan, Chamar, Chatr and Kundal,  \naccording to a Grah being in 2 to 6 combinations of good Vargas. Next is the Sapth Varg, in which these classifications continue in the same manner up to six  \ncombinations of good Vargas, the 7th additional Varg getting classified, as Mukut. In the Dasha Varg scheme the designations commence from Parijata etc., such  \nas 2 good Vargas - Parijatha, 3 Uttama, 4 Gopur, 5 Simhasan, 6 Paravata, 7 Devaloka, 8 Brahmaloka, 9 Sakravahana and 10 Vargas - Shridham. In the Shodasha  \nVarg scheme the combinations of Vargas go with designations thus: two good Vargas - Bhedak, 3 Kusum, 4 Nagapushpa, 5 Kanduk, 6 Kerala, 7 Kalpa Vriksha, 8  \nChandan Vana, 9 PurnaCandr, 10 Uchchaisrava, 11 Dhanvantari, 12 Suryakant, 13 Vidrum, 14 Chakra-Simhasan, 15 Golok and 16 Vargas - Sri Vallabh.

The divisions of a combust Grah, defeated Grah, weak Grah and a Grah in bad Avasthas, like Sayan, be all ignored to  \nbe auspicious, for these destroy the good Yogas. \n \nCh. 7. Divisional Considerations \n \n1-8. Use of the 16 Divisions. Now I will explain the use of these sixteen divisions. The physique from Lagn, wealth from Hora, happiness through co-born from  \nDreshkan, fortunes from Chaturthans, sons and grandsons from Saptans, spouse from Navans, power (and position) from Dashans, parents from Dvadashans,  \nbenefits  and  adversities  through  conveyances  from  Shodashans,  worship  from  Vimshans,  learning  from  Chaturvimshans,  strength  and  weakness  from  \nSaptavimshans, evil effects from Trimshans, auspicious and inauspicious effects from Khavedans and all indications from both Akshavedans and Shashtians: these  \nare the considerations to be made through the respective Vargas. The Bhava, whose Lord is in a malefic Shashtians, will diminish; so say Garga and others. The  \nBhava, whose Lord is in a benefic Shodashans, flourish. This is how the 16 Vargas are to be evaluated. 9-12. After assessing the 20 point strength of the  \nascending degree, of other Bhavas and of the Grahas, the good and bad effects be declared. I explain below the method of knowing the Vimsopak strength (20  \npoint strength), just by knowing which an idea of the results of actions of this birth and of former birth will clearly emerge. The Grahas from Surya on get full  \nstrength, when in exaltation, or in own Rashi and are bereft of strength, when in the 7th (from exaltation). In between the strength be known by the rule of three  \nprocess. In the case of a Grah, owning two Rashis, distinction of placement in odd/even Rashi identical with own Rashi be made. 13-16. Hora, Dreshkan and  \nTrimshans Effects. Guru, Surya and Mangal give (pronounced) effects in the Hora of Surya. Candr, Sukr and Sani do so, when in Candr\u2019s Horas; Budh is effective  \nin both the Horas. In the case of an even Rashi the Hora of Candr will be powerful in effects, while Surya\u2019s Hora in an odd Rashi will be so. Full, medium and nil will  \nbe the effects, respectively, in the beginning middle and the end of a Hora. Similar applications be made for a Dreshkan, Turyans, Navans etc. As for Trimshans  \neffects, Surya is akin to Mangal and Candr is akin to Sukr. The effects, applicable to Rashi, will apply to Trimshans. 17-19. Vimshopak Bal. The Shad Vargas  \nconsist of Rashi, Hora, Dreshkan, Navans, Dvadashans and Trimshans. The full Bal for each of the divisions, respectively, are 6, 2, 4, 5, 2 and 1. This is the  \nVimshopak Bal, relating to Shad Varg division.

When  \nthe 16 divisions (Shodash Varg Scheme) are considered together, the Vimshopak score goes thus: Hora 1, Trimsans 1, Dreshkan 1, Shodashans 2, Navans 3,  \nRashi 3\u00bd, Shashtians 4 and the rest of the nine divisions each a half. The Vimshopak Bal remains as 20, only when the Grah is in own Bhava Vargas. Otherwise,  \nthe total strength from 20 declines to 18 in Pramudit Vargas, to 15 in Shant Vargas, to 10 in Svasth divisions, to 7 in Duhkhit Vargas and to 5 in Khal Vargas.  \n(These figures are called Varg Vishwa) 26-27. Vimshopak Proportional Evaluation. Multiply the figure due to full strength for the division by the Varg Vishwa and  \ndivide by 20 to get the exact strength of the Grah. If the total is below 5, the Grah will not be capable of giving auspicious results. If it is above 5, but below 10, the  \nGrah will yield some good effects. Later on up to 15 it is indicative of mediocre effect. A Grah with above 15 will yield wholly favourable effects. 28-29. Other  \nSources of Strength. Maitreya, there are other kinds of sources, as I explain below. Grahas in the 7th from Surya will be fully effective. One with an identical  \nlongitude in comparison to Surya\u2019s will destroy the good effects. Rule of three process be applied to the Grah in between these positions. 30-32. Dasha effects with  \nVimshopak Bal. Maitreya, after assessing the Vimshopak Bal through the various divisions, the rising and setting of the Grahas be considered. The Vimshopak Bal  \nis classified under Purna, AtiPurna, Madhya, AtiMadhya, Heen, AtiHeen, Swalpa and AtiSwalp. Thus should be classified the Vimshopak Bal and the Dasha period  \nresults declared accordingly. 33-36. Kendras, Konas etc. defined. O Maitreya, listen to other matters, which I am explaining. The Kendras are specially known, as  \nLagn (the ascendent), Bandhu Bhava, Yuvati Bhava (the descendant) and Karm Bhava (mid-heaven). Dhan, Putr, Randhr and Labh Bhava are Panapharas  \n(succedents), while Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya Bhava are called Apoklimas (cadents). Putr and Dharm Bhava are known by the name Kon (or trine). Evil Bhavas,  \nor Dusthan Bhavas are Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava. Chaturasras are Bandhu and Randhr Bhava. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava are Upachaya Bhavas. 37-\n38. Names of Bhavas. Thanu, Dhan, Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr, Ari, Yuvati, Randhr, Dharm, Karma, Labh and Vyaya are in order the names of Bhavas. I explained these  \nbriefly and leave it to you to grasp more, according to your intelligence. As delivered by Lord Brahma, some further information is added thus (i.e. in the following  \nverses). 39-43. Indications from Bhavas. Dharm Bhava and the 9th from Surya deal with one\u2019s father. Whatever effects are to be known from the Karm and Labh  \nBhava, be also known from similar Bhavas, counted from Surya. Whatever results are to be known from Bandhu, Tanu, Dhan, Labh and Dharm should also be  \nknown from the 4th of Candr, from Kark Rashi itself and from the 2nd, 11th and 9th from Candr, respectively. Whatever has to be known through Sahaj Bhava, be  \nalso analyzed through the 3rd from Mangal.

O Maitreya, now detailed are the Drishtis, emanating from the Rashi Mesh etc. Every Movable Rashi drishties the 3 Fixed Rashis, leaving the  \nFixed Rashi adjacent to it. Every Fixed Rashi gives Drishti to the 3 Movable Rashis, barring the adjacent Movable Rashi. And a Common Rashi gives a Drishti to  \nthe other three Common Rashis. The Grah in a Rashi gives the same Drishti, as the Rashi (in which the Grah is) does. 4-5. Dristhis of the Grahas. A Grah in a  \nMovable Rashi gives a Drishti to the other 3 Fixed Rashis, leaving the Fixed Rashi next to it. A Grah in a Fixed Rashi does not give a Drishti to the next Movable  \nRashi, but the remaining 3 Movable Rashis. The one in a Common Rashi gives a Drishti to the remaining 3 Common Rashis. Simultaneously a Grah in the Rashi,  \nthat receives a Drishti, is also subjected to the Drishti concerned. 6-9. Diagram of Dristhis. As depicted by Lord Brahma, I now narrate the diagram of Drishtis, so  \nthat Drishtis are easily understood by a mere sight of the diagram. Draw a square, or a circle marking the 8 directions (4 corners and 4 quarters thereof). Mark the  \nzodiacal Rashis, as under: Mesh and Vrishabh in East, Mithun in the North-East, Kark and Simh in the North, Kanya in the North-West, Tula and Vrischik in the  \nWest, Dhanu in the South-West, Makar and Kumbh in the South and Meen in the South-East. Addition Santhanam till Ch. 9. The Drishtis (as per the earlier Slokas)  \ncan be shown in a square diagram, or circular diagram (as per convenience). \n \nCh. 9. Evils at Birth \n \n1. O Brahmin, first of all estimate the evils and checking factors thereof through Lagn and then declare the effects of the 12 Bhavas. 2. Evils, causing premature  \nend, exist up to the 24th year of one\u2019s age. As such, no definite calculation of life span should be made till such year of age. 3-6. Short-life Combinations (up to  \nSloka 23). Should Candr be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava and receives a Drishti from a malefic, the child will die soon. If in the process there be a Drishti from a  \nbenefic, it may live up to 8. If a benefic is retrograde in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, death will occur within a month of birth. This  \nis true, only when Lagn is not occupied by a benefic. Should Putr Bhava be occupied by Sani, Mangal and Surya jointly, (early) death of mother and brother will  \ncome to pass. Mangal, placed in Tanu, or in Randhr Bhava and be yuti with Sani, or Surya, or receiving a Drishti from a malefic, being bereft of a Drishti from a  \nbenefic, will prove a source of (immediate) death. 7-11. If Sani and Mangal give a Drishti to Lagn, as the luminaries are yuti with Rahu (elsewhere), the child will live  \na fortnight.

Malefic in Vyaya and Ari Bhava, or in Randhr and Dhan Bhava, while Lagn is hemmed between other malefics,  \nwill bring early death. 17.

With a malefic in Yuvati Bhava, or in the rising  \nDreshkan, while decreasing Candr is in Tanu Bhava, death be experienced early. 23. The life span of the child will be either 2 months, or 6 months only, if all  \nGrahas devoid of strength are relegated to Apoklima Bhavas. 24. Evils to Mother (up to Sloka 33). The mother of the native will incur evils (will die soon), if Candr at  \nbirth receives a Drishti from three malefics. Benefics, giving a Drishti to Candr, will bring good to the mother. 25.

Evil to Father  \n(up to Sloka 42). One\u2019s father will incur early death, if Sani, Mangal and Candr in their orders are in Tanu, Yuvati and Ari Bhava. 35. The native will at the time of his  \nmarriage lose his father, if Guru is in Tanu Bhava, while Sani, Surya, Mangal and Budh are together in Dhan Bhava. 36. Early loss of father will take place, if Surya  \nis with a malefic, or is hemmed between malefics, as there is another malefic in the 7th from Surya. 37.

If Surya receives a Drishti from Sani and be in Mesh, or in Vrischik Navans, the father would have given up the family before birth of the  \nchild, or would have passed away. 41. If Bandhu, Karm and Vyaya Bhava are all occupied by malefics, both the parents will leave the child to its own fate and  \nwander from place to place. 42. The father will not see the native till his (the native\u2019s) 23rd year, if Rahu and Guru are together in an inimical Rashi identical with  \nTanu, or Bandhu Bhava. 43-45. Parents. Surya is the indicator of father for all beings, while the mother is indicated by Candr. Should Surya receive a Drishti from  \none, or more malefics, or be hemmed between them, this will cause evils to father. Similarly Candr be considered in respect of mother. Malefics in the 6th, the 8th,  \nor the 4th from Surya will bring inauspicious results about the father. Malefics in such places from Candr will be adverse for the mother. The strength, or otherwise  \nof the occupants concerned be suitably estimated. \n \nCh. 10. Antidotes for Evils \n \n1. Those are the evils (due to a native). I now narrate the antidotes for such evils as well, which will be helpful to assess the extent of inauspiciousness. 2. Should  \none among Budh, Guru and Sukr be in an angle from Lagn, all evils are destroyed, as Surya eliminates darkness. 3. Just as a single reverential obeisance before  \nLord Shiva, the Trident holder frees one from all sins, a single, but strong Guru in Lagn will ward off all the evils. 4. Lagn Lord is singly capable of counteracting all  \nevils, if he is strongly placed in an angle, just as Lord Shiva, the holder of the Bow destroyed the three cities, built of gold, silver and iron for the demons by Maya.  \n5. All evils are destroyed, if a benefic drishties Lagn of one born during the night in the bright half. Similarly a malefic\u2019s Drishti on Lagn of one born during day time  \nin the dark half. 6. Surya in Vyaya will confer a hundred-year life span on one born in Tul Lagn. 7. It will prove auspicious for the mother as well as the native, if  \nMangal joins, or is drishtied by Guru. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e0eb14b-6068-4cbf-ab92-79acbde76d3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e0eb14b-6068-4cbf-ab92-79acbde76d3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e0b047b2-6afa-4702-bde3-a151fc1d1230", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "d25766e2329174afda192d3fc99819ca7d8ccd3ba31afecb79589e2b352433d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ff06c4c-e764-4a53-853e-10c64d7b25dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "707f380e4d58510063c52bab5833a34b6e685255d0e4a98eafc223c2ba087c0c"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb40ee32-85a2-4b85-9f47-a3b2f8fbb2c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "16345a55125a38c190e3bd1c6d6ab24c736b58de4117809ab9fb72d15d729059"}}, "hash": "57e3a4b6de04850dfa095abedc95b73884ca87a108f4a1de6174061e96fe56f9", "text": "8.

Indications of  \nTanu Bhava. Maharishi Parashar replies. Physique, appearance, intellect (or the organ of intelligence, i.e. brain), complexion of the body, vigour, weakness,  \nhappiness, grief and innate nature are all to be guessed through the ascending Rashi. 3.

From Sahaj Bhava know of the following: valour,  \nservants (attending etc.), brothers, sisters etc., initiatory instructions (Upadesh), journey and parent\u2019s death. 5. Indications of Bandhu Bhava. Conveyances,  \nrelatives, mother, happiness, treasure, lands and buildings are to be consulted through Bandhu Bhava. 6. Indications of Putr Bhava. The learned should deduce  \nfrom Putr Bhava amulets, sacred spells, learning, knowledge, sons, royalty (or authority), fall of position etc. 7. Indications of Ari Bhava. Maternal uncle, doubts  \nabout death, enemies, ulcers, step-mother etc. are to be estimated from Ari Bhava. 8. Indications of Yuvati Bhava. Wife, travel, trade, loss of sight, death etc. be  \nknown from Yuvati Bhava. 9. Indications of Randhr Bhava. Randhr Bhava indicates longevity, battle, enemies, forts, wealth of the dead and things, that have  \nhappened and are to happen (in the past and future births). 10. Indications of Dharm Bhava. Fortunes, wife\u2019s brother, religion, brother\u2019s wife, visits to shrines etc. be  \nknown from Dharm Bhava. 11. Indications of Karm Bhava. Royalty (authority), place, profession (livelihood), honour, father, living in foreign lands and debts are to  \nbe understood from Karm Bhava. 12. Indications of Labh Bhava.

From Vyaya Bhava, one can know about expenses, history of enemies, one\u2019s own death etc. 14-16. Prosperity, or Annihilation of a  \nBhava. Predict prosperity of the Bhava, which is yuti with, or drishtied by a benefic. Also, when its Lord is in Yuvavastha, or Prabuddhavastha, or in Kismaravastha,  \nor in Karm Bhava, the Bhavas well-being is indicated. The Bhava, which is not drishtied by its Lord, or, whose Lord is with a malefic Grah, or with one of the Lords  \nof evil and such other Bhavas (i.e. 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th and 12th), or is defeated in a war between Grahas, or is in one of the three Avasthas, viz, Vriddhavastha,  \nMritavastha and Suptavastha. \n \nCh. 12. Effects of Tanu Bhava \n \n1-2. Physical comforts. Should Lagn Lord be yuti with a malefic, or be in Randhr, 6th, or 12th, physical felicity will diminish.

If Budh, Guru, or Sukr be in 4th, 7th, or  \n10th from Lagn, or be in the company of Candr in Lagn, the native will enjoy royal fortunes. 8. Coiled Birth. If there be a birth in one of Mesh, Vrishabh and Simh  \nLagnas, containing either Sani, or Mangal, the birth of the child is with a coil around a limb. The corresponding limb will be in accordance with the Rashi, or Navans,  \nrising. 9. Birth of Twins. The native, who has Surya in a quadruped Rashi, while others are in Dual Rashis with strength, is born, as one of the twins. 10. To Be  \nNurtured by Three Mothers. If Surya and Candr join in one and the same Bhava and fall in one Navans, the native will be nurtured by three different mothers for the  \nfirst three months from its birth and will later on be brought up by its father and brother. (\u2018Bhratri\u2019 apart from meaning a brother calls for interpretation, as a near  \nrelative in general) 11. Important. The learned in Jyotish should base the effects on Candr also, as are applicable to Lagn. Now explained are clues to know of  \nulcers, identity marks etc. on one\u2019s person. 12-14. Decanates and Bodily Limbs. Head, eyes, ears, nose, temple, chin and face is the order of limbs, denoted (by  \nthe various Bhavas), when the first decanate of a Rashi ascends. In the case of the second decanate ascending the order is neck, shoulder, arm, side, heart,  \nstomach and navel. The order for the third decanate ascending is pelvis, anus/penis, testicles, thigh, knee, calf and foot. The portion already risen indicates left side  \nof the body (while the one yet to rise, i.e. the invisible half, denotes the right side of the body). 15. Limbs Affected. The limb, related to a malefic by occupation, will  \nhave ulcers, or scars, while the one, related to a benefic, will have a mark (like moles etc). So say the Jyotishis. (Also see Sloka 6, Ch. 4 of Saravali, which states,  \nthat a malefic, or a benefic, if be in own Rashi, or Navans, the effects will be right from birth. In other cases it will be in the course of one\u2019s life, that these effects will  \ncome to pass) \n \nCh. 13. Effects of Dhan Bhava \n \n1-2. Combinations for Wealth. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me, speaking on the effects of Dhan Bhava. If the Lord of Dhan is in Dhan, or is in an angle, or  \nin trine, he will promote one\u2019s wealth (or monetary state). Should he be in Ari/8th/12th, financial conditions will decline. A benefic in Dhan will give wealth, while a  \nmalefic instead will destroy wealth. 3. One will be wealthy, if Guru is in Dhan, as the Lord of Dhan, or is with Mangal. 4. If Dhan Lord is in Labh, while the Lord of  \nLabh in Dhan, wealth will be acquired by the native. Alternately these two Lords may join in an angle, or in a trine. 5. If the Lord of Dhan is in an angle, while Labh  \nLord is in a trine thereof, or is drishtied by, or yuti with Guru and Sukr, the subject will be wealthy. 6-7. Yogas for Poverty. One will be penniless, if the Lord of Dhan  \nBhava is in an evil Bhava, while the Lord of Labh Bhava is also so placed and Dhan Bhava is occupied by a malefic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0381375c-a897-4fee-a1ee-e45205393682": {"__data__": {"id_": "0381375c-a897-4fee-a1ee-e45205393682", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc0a053e-b0ac-4df9-9c2f-83ceb2f268ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "31b25b7508dc20a725e3b78c67be2e72c90aab07f5819cb32310f9cd9937423d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b6ab2b0-caae-40f9-8cb7-ecd9f25626b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "4b2916494528f1752aa64d2dda18c6b425dad75c2127eae64d9c890908fe9d69"}, "3": {"node_id": "24c48234-dea2-4a98-b203-ed30197fb241", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b5f11e20a115626aa3035b0730a5d94d1cb829a918fdb352fb95fcae5b5bebcc"}}, "hash": "be2c36c646e724a6c823220a2254765fc62c97ae1ee867bc40fcfa88ff46a189", "text": "There will be penury right from birth and the  \nnative will have to beg even for his food, if the Lords of Dhan and Labh Bhava are both combust, or with malefics. 8. Loss of Wealth through the King. Should the  \nLords of Dhan and Labh Bhava be relegated to Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, while Mangal is in Labh Bhava and Rahu is in Dhan Bhava, the native will lose his  \nwealth on account of royal punishments. 9. Expenses on Good Accounts. When Guru is in Labh, Sukr is in Dhan and a benefic is placed in Vyaya Bhava, while  \nDhan\u2019s Lord is yuti with a benefic, there will be expenses on religious, or charitable grounds. 10. Fame etc. If Dhan\u2019s Lord is in own Rashi, or is exalted, the native  \nwill look after his people, will help others and also will become famous. 11. Effortless Aquisition. If Dhan\u2019s Lord is yuti with a benefic and is in a good division, like  \nParavatans, there will be effortlessly all kinds of wealth in the native\u2019s family. (\u201cParavatansdau\u201d of the text denotes Paravat, or such other higher Vargas: Dhan\u2019s  \nLord should be in Paravatans, or in Devalokans, Brahmalokans, Sakravahanans, or Sridhamans in the Dash Varg scheme) 12. Eyes. If Dhan Lord is endowed with  \nstrength, the native will possess beautiful eyes. Should the said Grah be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be disease, or deformity of eyes. 13. Untruthful  \nPerson. If Dhan Bhava and its Lord are yuti with malefics, the native will be a talebearer, will speak untruth and will be afflicted by windy diseases. \n \nCh. 14. Effects of Sahaj Bhava \n \n1. O Brahmin, I now tell you about Sahaj Bhava. Should Sahaj Bhava be yuti with, or drishtied by a benefic, the native will be endowed with co-born and be  \ncourageous. 2. If Sahaj\u2019s Lord along with Mangal drishties Sahaj Bhava, the native will enjoy good results, due to Sahaj Bhava. Alternatively these two Grahas may  \nbe in Sahaj itself. 3. Destruction at once of co-born will come to pass, if the said 2 Grahas are together with a malefic, or in a Rashi, owned by a malefic. 4-4\u00bd.  \nFemale and Male Co-born. If Sahaj\u2019s Lord is a female Grah, or, if Sahaj Bhava be occupied by female Grahas, one will have sisters, born after him. Similarly male  \nGrahas and male Rashis denote younger brothers. Should it be of mixed nature, co-born of both sexes will be obtained. These effects be declared after assessing  \nthe strength and weakness of the concerned. 5-6. Should Sahaj\u2019s Lord and Mangal be together in Randhr Bhava, destruction of co-born will result. Happiness in  \nthis respect will come to pass, if Mangal, or Sahaj\u2019s Lord is in an angle, or in a trine, or in exaltation, or friendly divisions. 7-11. Number of Brothers and Sisters. If  \nBudh is in Sahaj Bhava, while Sahaj\u2019s Lord and Candr are together, as the indicator (Mangal) joins Sani, the effects are: there occurred the birth of an elder sister  \nand there will be younger brothers. Furthermore, the third brother will die. Should Mangal be yuti with Rahu, while Sahaj\u2019s Lord is in his debilitation Rashi, there will  \nbe loss of younger brothers and/or sisters, while three elder brothers and/or sisters were attained by the native.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24c48234-dea2-4a98-b203-ed30197fb241": {"__data__": {"id_": "24c48234-dea2-4a98-b203-ed30197fb241", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc0a053e-b0ac-4df9-9c2f-83ceb2f268ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "31b25b7508dc20a725e3b78c67be2e72c90aab07f5819cb32310f9cd9937423d"}, "2": {"node_id": "0381375c-a897-4fee-a1ee-e45205393682", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "be2c36c646e724a6c823220a2254765fc62c97ae1ee867bc40fcfa88ff46a189"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a81e9a1-0c04-4af0-b8fa-00ae575d3eaa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b2aaa01c1a64a8863e2c22739c61331ebf650583fc249896ff4ad39ad7da1502"}}, "hash": "b5f11e20a115626aa3035b0730a5d94d1cb829a918fdb352fb95fcae5b5bebcc", "text": "If Sahaj\u2019s Lord is in an angle, while the significator  \n(Mangal) is exalted in a trine and be yuti with Guru, 12 will be the number of total co-born. Out of these two elders and the 3rd, the 7th, the 9th and the 12th of the  \nyounger co-born will be shortlived, while six of the said twelve will be longlived. 12-13. There will be 1 co-born, if Vyaya\u2019s Lord (some texts read, as Labh\u2019s Lord)  \njoins Mangal and Guru, while Sahaj Bhava is occupied by Candr. If Candr is lonely placed in Sahaj Bhava with Drishti of male Grahas, there will be younger  \nbrothers, while the Drishti of Sukr denotes younger sisters. 14. Adverse Grahas. Surya in Sahaj Bhava will destroy the preborn. The afterborn will be destroyed, if  \nSani is found in Sahaj Bhava. In the same situation Mangal will destroy both the preborn and later-born. 15. After estimating the strength and weakness of such  \nYogas, the effects, related to brothers and sisters, be announced. \n \nCh. 15. Effects of Bandhu Bhava \n \n1. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have been briefly told the effects of Sahaj Bhava. Now listen to the results, related to Bandhu Bhava. 2. Housing Comforts.  \nOne will have residential comforts in full degree, if Bandhu is occupied by its Lord, or by Lagn\u2019s Lord and be drishtied by a benefic. 3. Miscellaneous. Should Putr\u2019s  \nLord be in his own Bhava, or in own Navans, or in exaltation, the native will be endowed with comforts, related to lands, conveyances, houses etc. and musical  \ninstruments. 4. Housing Comforts. If Karm\u2019s Lord joins Bandhu\u2019s Lord in an angle, or in a trine, the native will acquire beautiful mansions. 5. Relatives. Should Budh  \nbe in Lagn, while Bandhu\u2019s Lord, being a benefic, is drishtied by another benefic, the native will be honoured by his relatives. 6. Long-living Mother. If Bandhu  \nBhava is occupied by a benefic, while its Lord is in his exaltation Rashi, as the indicator of mother is endowed with strength, the native will have a long-living  \nmother. 7. Happiness of Mother. The native\u2019s mother will be happy, if Bandhu\u2019s Lord is in an angle, while Sukr is also in an angle, as Budh is exalted. 8.  \nQuadrupeds. Surya in Bandhu, Candr and Sani in Dharm and Mangal in Labh Bhava; this Yoga will confer cows and buffaloes on the native. 9. Dumbness. Should  \nBandhu Bhava be a Movable one, while its Lord and Mangal are together in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will be dumb. 10-14. Conveyances. If Lagn\u2019s Lord is a  \nbenefic, while Bandhu\u2019s Lord is in fall, or in Labh Bhava and the significator (Sukr) is in Vyaya Bhava, the native will obtain conveyances in his 12th year. Should  \nSurya be in Bandhu Bhava, as Bandhu\u2019s Lord is exalted and be with Sukr, one will acquire conveyances in his 32nd year. It will be in the 42nd year, that one will be  \nendowed with conveyances, if Bandhu\u2019s Lord joins Karm\u2019s Lord in his (4th Lord\u2019s) exaltation Navans. An exchange between Labh\u2019s and Bandhu\u2019s Lords will confer  \nconveyances in the 12th year. A benefic, related to Bandhu Bhava (and to its Lord), will bring with him auspicious effects (regarding conveyances), while a malefic  \nwill produce only malefic effects (in respect of conveyances).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a81e9a1-0c04-4af0-b8fa-00ae575d3eaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a81e9a1-0c04-4af0-b8fa-00ae575d3eaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc0a053e-b0ac-4df9-9c2f-83ceb2f268ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "31b25b7508dc20a725e3b78c67be2e72c90aab07f5819cb32310f9cd9937423d"}, "2": {"node_id": "24c48234-dea2-4a98-b203-ed30197fb241", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b5f11e20a115626aa3035b0730a5d94d1cb829a918fdb352fb95fcae5b5bebcc"}}, "hash": "b2aaa01c1a64a8863e2c22739c61331ebf650583fc249896ff4ad39ad7da1502", "text": "Should a benefic be in Bandhu, drishti Bandhu, or in yuti with the Lord of Bandhu, or a Drishti on the  \nLord of Bandhu Bhava, then the native will be happy with conveyances and be free from accidents and dangers.

O Brahmin, now I tell you the effects, related to Putr Bhava. If the Lords of Lagn and Putr are in their own Rashis, or in an angle, or in a trine, one will enjoy  \nthorough happiness through his children. Should Putr\u2019s Lord be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be no offspring. Should the Lord of Putr be combust, or  \nbe with malefics and be weak, there will be no children; even, if per chance issues are obtained, they will only quit the world soon. The Yuti of Putr\u2019s Lord with  \nLagn\u2019s Lord in a good Bhava will ensure early obtainment of children apart from happiness through them. If they join in an evil Bhava, they will prove a defect in this  \nrespect. 4. If Putr\u2019s Lord is in Ari Bhava, as Lagn\u2019s Lord is yuti with Mangal, the native will lose his very first child, whereafter his female will not be fertile to yield an  \noffspring. 5. Should Putr\u2019s Lord be in fall in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, while Budh and Ketu are in Putr Bhava, the native\u2019s wife will give birth to one child only. 6.  \nIf Putr\u2019s Lord is in fall and be not in Drishti to Putr, while Sani and Budh are in Putr, the native\u2019s wife will give birth to one child only. 7. Should Dharm\u2019s Lord be in  \nLagn, while Putr\u2019s Lord is in fall and Ketu is in Putr along with Budh, obtainment of progeny will be after a great deal of ordeal. 8. If Putr\u2019s Lord is in Ari, Randhr, or  \nVyaya Bhava, or be in an inimical Rashi, or be in fall, or in Putr itself, the native will beget issues with difficulty. 9. Should Putr Bhava be owned by Sani, or Budh  \nand be occupied, or drishtied by Sani and Mandi, one will have adopted issues. 10. Should Surya and Candr be together in a Rashi and in the same Navans, the  \nnative will be brought up by three mothers, or two fathers. 11. Adopted issue is indicated, if Putr is tenanted by six Grahas, while its Lord is in Vyaya Bhava and  \nCandr and Lagn are endowed with strength. 12. There will be many children, if Putr\u2019s Lord is strong, while Putr is drishtied by strong Budh, Guru and Sukr. 13. If  \nPutr\u2019s Lord is with Candr, or is in her Decanate, the native will beget daughters; so say Jyotishis. 14. If Putr\u2019s Lord is in a Movable Rashi, while Sani is in Putr, as  \nRahu is with Candr, the child (so born) is of questionable birth. 15. Undoubtedly the native is born of other\u2019s loins, if Candr is in the 8th from Lagn, while Guru is in  \nthe 8th from Candr. Malefic\u2019s Drishti, or Yuti is essential in this Yog. 16. If Putr\u2019s Lord is exalted, or be in Dhan, Putr, or Dharm Bhava, or be yuti with, or drishtied by  \nGuru, obtainment of children will be there. 17. One will obtain children, that will indulge in mean deeds, if Putr is occupied by three, or four malefics, while Putr\u2019s  \nLord is in fall. A benefic (including Budh) in Putr is excluded in the said combination. 18. If Putr is occupied by Guru, while its Lord is with Sukr, one will obtain an  \noffspring in his 32nd, or 33rd year. 19. Should Putr\u2019s Lord be in an angle along with Guru, the Karak, one will beget a child at the age of 30, or 36. 20.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e37cc2e0-7a0e-4e47-a86e-aa513113ac2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e37cc2e0-7a0e-4e47-a86e-aa513113ac2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d0d705c-1488-4323-9c14-16a1a963ebdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6108c009d8bffc58b7d33b758e4bfbd9a81a483ecef8be3a961df899ed73c5e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fac31d6-1aeb-41a4-a12d-d20a95d213d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "48acdac75d9731cedc4ddc6150ca95409b8f1509bdc7f3131cbb4aeb00556270"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cc82d0e-e8ab-453c-a343-ce3d8e9fdc2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "982d0b10fb0632176ea4485c76d6f6c302cd1084804fcc0cf93867b81ffa636b"}}, "hash": "543f38282a77ddcca1c577d55ae425b07d2031d71661e94123910e5bef206575", "text": "20.

Should Mandi be in Lagn, while Lagn\u2019s Lord is in fall, grief on account of loss of child at the age of 56 will come to pass.  \n24-32. Number of Children. There will be 10 sons, if Bandhu Bhava and Ari Bhava are occupied by malefics, while Putr\u2019s Lord is in deep exaltation, joining Lagn\u2019s  \nLord, as Guru is with another benefic. Nine will be the number of sons, that one will beget, if Guru is in deep exaltation, as Rahu is with Dhan\u2019s Lord and Dharm is  \noccupied by its own Lord.

Only one son is denoted, if there be a malefic in Putr Bhava, while Guru is in the 5th from Sani, or vice  \nversa. If Putr Bhava has a malefic in it, or, if Sani is in the 5th from Guru, the native will beget offspring only through his second, or third wife. Should Putr be  \noccupied by a malefic, while Guru is yuti with Sani in Putr Bhava, as Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Dhan Bhava and Putr\u2019s Lord is yuti with Mangal, one will live long, but lose his  \nchildren one after the other, as they are born. \n \nCh. 17. Effects of Ari Bhava \n \n1. O Brahmin, following are the effects, produced by Ari Bhava, relating to diseases, ulcers etc. Listen to this attentively. 2. Ulcers/Bruises. Should Ari\u2019s Lord be in  \nAri itself, or in Lagn, or Randhr, there will be ulcers, or bruises on the body. The Rashi, becoming Ari Bhava, will lead to the knowledge of the concerned limb. 3-5.  \nRelatives Affected. The Karak of a relative, or the Lord of such a Bhava, joining Ari\u2019s Lord, or being in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, indicates ulcers/bruises to such a  \nrelative, like father. Surya with such lordship and in such a Bhava denotes such affectation of head, Candr of the face, Mangal of the neck, Budh of the navel, Guru  \nof the nose, Sukr of the eyes, Sani of the feet and the Rahu and Ketu of the abdomen. 6. Facial Diseases. Should Lagn\u2019s Lord be in a Rashi of Mangal, or of Budh  \nand has a Drishti on Budh, there will be diseases of the face. 7-8\u00bd. Leprosy. Mangal, or Budh, having ownership of the ascending Rashi and joining Candr, Rahu  \nand Sani, will cause leprosy. If Candr is in Lagn, which is not however Cancer, and be with Rahu, there will occur white leprosy. Sani in place of Rahu will cause  \nblack leprosy, while Mangal similarly will afflict one with blood-leprosy. 9-12\u00bd.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cc82d0e-e8ab-453c-a343-ce3d8e9fdc2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cc82d0e-e8ab-453c-a343-ce3d8e9fdc2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d0d705c-1488-4323-9c14-16a1a963ebdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6108c009d8bffc58b7d33b758e4bfbd9a81a483ecef8be3a961df899ed73c5e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "e37cc2e0-7a0e-4e47-a86e-aa513113ac2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "543f38282a77ddcca1c577d55ae425b07d2031d71661e94123910e5bef206575"}, "3": {"node_id": "e11accb8-5214-4aed-909f-e0a62b2a5c7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "da73056a36c3399c6fc00a183c4782fd8b032999210d16a776ca8e65e2600ae6"}}, "hash": "982d0b10fb0632176ea4485c76d6f6c302cd1084804fcc0cf93867b81ffa636b", "text": "9-12\u00bd. Diseases in General. When Lagn is occupied by the Lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava  \nalong with Surya, the native will be afflicted by fever and tumours. Mangal, replacing Surya, will cause swelling and hardening of the blood vessels and wounds and  \nhits by weapons. Budh so featuring will bring in billious diseases, while Guru in similar case will destroy any disease. Similarly Sukr will cause diseases through  \nfemales, Sani windy diseases, Rahu danger through low-caste-men and Ketu navel diseases. Candr in Yuti with the Lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava will inflict  \ndangers through water and phlegmatic disorders. Similar estimates be made from the respective significators and Bhavas for relatives, like father. 13-19\u00bd TIMING  \nOF ILLNESS. The native will be afflicted by illness throughout life, if Sani is with Rahu, while Ari Lord and 6th Bhava are yuti with malefics. One will suffer from  \n(severe) fever at the age of 6 and at the age of 12, if Mangal is in Ari, while Ari Lord is in Randhr. If the Candr is in Dhanu/Meen, while Guru is in Ari from Lagn, one  \nwill suffer from leprosy at the age of 19 and 22. If Rahu is in Ari, Lagna Lord is in Randhr and Mandi is in an angle, consumption will trouble the native at the age of  \n26. Spleenary disorders will be experienced at the age of 29 and 30, if the Lords of 6th and 12th are in exchange of their Rashis. Sani and Candr together in Ari will  \ninflict blood-leprosy at the age of 45. If Sani is with an inimical planet, while Lagn Lord is in Lagn itself, windy disorders (like rheumatism) will trouble the native at  \nthe age of 59. 20-22. UNFORTUNATE YEARS. Should Candr be yuti with Ari Lord, while the 8th Lord is in Ari and the 12th Lord is in Lagn, the native will be  \ntroubled by animals at the age of eight. O Brahmin, if Rahu is in Ari, while Sani is in Randhr from the said Rahu, the child will have danger through fire at the age of  \n1 and 2, while in Sahaj year birds will bring some evils. 23-25. UNFORTUNATE YEARS (continued). Danger through water will have to be feared during Putr and  \nDharm years, if Surya is in Ari, or Randhr, while Candr is in Vyaya from the said Surya. Sani in Randhr, as Mangal is in Yuvati, all cause small-pox in Karm year  \nand in 30th year of age. If 8th Lord joins Rahu in an angle/trine from Randhr Bhava and be in Randhr in Navamsa, the subject will be troubled by swelling of blood  \nvessels, urinary disorders etc. during the 18th year and the 22nd year. 26. LOSS THROUGH ENEMIES. Loss of wealth will come to pass during the 31st year, if  \nLabh and 6th Lords exchange their Rashis. 27. INIMICAL SONS. One\u2019s own sons will be his enemies, if Putr Lord is in Ari, while Ari Lord is with Guru.  \nSimultaneously Vyaya Lord should be in Lagn. 28. FEAR FROM DOGS. There will be fear from dogs during the 10th and 19th year, if the Lagna Lord and the 6th  \nLord are in exchange. \n \nCh. 18. Effects of Yuvati Bhava \n \n1. O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me, detailing the effects of the 7th Bhava. If Yuvati Lord is in his own Rashi, or in exaltation, one will derive full happiness  \nthrough his wife (and marriage). 2. SICK WIFE.

Excessive\u00b7Libidinousness/Death\u00b7of\u00b7Wife. If Sukr is in Yuvati, the native will be exceedingly libidinous. If Sukr yuti a malefic in any  \nBhava, it will cause loss of wife. 4-5. THE 7TH LORD. Should Yuvati Lord be endowed with strength and be yuti with, or be drishtied by a benefic, the native will be  \nwealthy, honourable, happy and fortunate. Conversely, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, or is combust, or is in an enemy\u2019s Rashi, one will acquire sick wives and many wives.  \n6. PLURALITY OF WIVES. If Yuvati Lord is in a Rashi of Sani, or of Sukr and be drishtied by a benefic, there will be many wives. Should Yuvati Lord be particularly  \nin exaltation, the same effects will come to pass. 7-8\u00bd. MlSCELLANEOUS MATTERS. The native will befriend barren females, if Surya is in Yuvati. Candr therein  \nwill cause association with such female, as corresponding to the Rashi, becoming Yuvati. Mangal, placed in Yuvati, will denote association with marriageable girls  \n(those with menses), or with barren females. Budh indicates harlots, mean females and females, belonging to traders\u2019 community. Wife of a Brahmin, or a pregnant  \nfemale will be in the native\u2019s association, if Guru is in Yuvati. Base females and females, having attained their courses, are denoted by Sani, Rahu/Ketu in Yuvati.  \n8-9\u00bd. Mangal denotes a female with attractive breasts. Sani indicates sick and weak spouse. Guru will bring a spouse with hard and prominent breasts. Sukr will  \nbring one with bulky and excellent breasts. 10-13\u00bd.

If Sukr is so related to Sani, the native will \u201ckiss\u201d the private parts of the male. 14-15. WORTHY SPOUSE. The native will beget a  \nspouse endowed with (the seven principal) virtues, who will expand his dynasty by sons and grandsons, if the 7th Lord is exalted, while Yuvati is occupied by strong  \nLagna Lord and a benefic. 16. EVILS TO SPOUSE. If Yuvati Bhava, or its Lord is yuti with a malefic the native\u2019s wife will incur evils, especially, if Yuvati Bhava, or  \nits Lord is bereft of strength. 17. LOSS OF SPOUSE. If Yuvati Lord is devoid of strength and is relegated to Ari, 8th, or Vyaya, or, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, the native\u2019s  \nwife will be destroyed (i.e. she will die early). 18. LACK OF CONJUGAL FELICITY. If Candr is in Yuvati, as Yuvati Lord is in Vyaya and the Karaka (indicator Sukr)  \nis bereft of strength, the native will not be endowed with marital happiness. 19-21. PLURALlIY OF WIVES. One will have two wives, if Yuvati Lord is in fall, or in a  \nmalefic Rashi along with a malefic, while Yuvati Bhava, or the 7th Navamsa belong to a eunuch planet. If Mangal and Sukr are in Yuvati, or, if Sani is Yuvati, while  \nthe Lord of Lagn is in Randhr, the native will have 3 wives. There will be many wives, if Sukr is in a Dual Rashi, while its Lord is in exaltation, as Yuvati Lord is  \nendowed with strength. 22. TIME OF MARRIAGE (upto Sloka 34). If Yuvati Lord is in a benefic\u2019s Bhava (or in Dharm, as Subha Rashi so means), while Sukr is  \nexalted, or is in own Rashi, the native will marry at the age of 5, or 9. 23. If Surya is in Yuvati, while his dispositor is yuti with Sukr, there will be marriage at 7th, or  \n11th year of age. 24. Sukr in Dhan, while Yuvati Lord is in Labh will give marriage at the age of 10, or 16. 25. Marriage will take place during the 11th year, if Sukr is  \nin an angle from Lagn, while Lagn Lord is in Makar, or Kumbh. 26. The native will marry at 12, or l9, if Sukr is in an angle from the Lagna, while Sani is in Yuvati  \ncounted from Sukr. 27. Should Sukr be in Yuvati from Candr, while Sani is in Yuvati from Sukr, marriage will be in the 18th year. 28. Marriage will be in the 15th  \nyear, if Dhan Lord is in Labh, while Lagn Lord is in Karm. 29. An exchange between the Lords of Dhan and Labh will bring marriage 13 years after birth. 30.

O excellent of the Brahmins, listen to me speak on the effects of Randhr Bhava. If Randhr\u2019s Lord is in an angle, long life is indicated. 2. Short Life.  \nShould Randhr\u2019s Lord join Lagn\u2019s Lord, or a malefic and be in Randhr itself, the native will be short lived. 3. Sani and Karm\u2019s Lord about Longevity. Similarly  \nconsider Sani and Karm\u2019s Lord in the matter of longevity. Karm\u2019s Lord is in Randhr along with a malefic Grah and/or Lagn\u2019s Lord. 4-7. Long Life. There will be long  \nlife, if Ari\u2019s Lord is in Vyaya, or, if Ari\u2019s Lord is in Ari, as Vyaya\u2019s Lord is in Vyaya, or, if Ari\u2019s Lord and Vyaya\u2019s Lord are in Lagn and Randhr. If the Lords of Putr,  \nRandhr and Tanu Bhava are in own Navansas, own Rashis, or in friendly Rashis, the native will enjoy a long span of life. Should the Lords of Lagn, Randhr and  \nKarm Bhava and Sani are all disposed severally in an angle, in a trine, or in Labh Bhava, the subject will live long. Like these, there are many other Yogas, dealing  \nwith the issue of longevity. The strength and weakness of the Grahas concerned be estimated in deciding longevity. 8-13. Short Life. One\u2019s span of life will be  \nbetween 20 and 32 years, if Lagn\u2019s Lord is weak, while Randhr\u2019s Lord is an angle. The native will only be short-lived, if Randhr\u2019s Lord is in fall, while Randhr Bhava  \nhas a malefic in it and Tanu Bhava is bereft of strength. Death will be instant at birth, if Randhr Bhava, Randhr\u2019s Lord and Vyaya Bhava are all conjunct malefics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1af65171-f1dd-4ffb-9c44-1468f6267396": {"__data__": {"id_": "1af65171-f1dd-4ffb-9c44-1468f6267396", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04207c86-3c4e-4291-ac24-1c220a8cad8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c95ebbb809436467df751384ce93c2c7a69636cd93e0b945f43e26fd8b8fa2d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f06c898-1b28-468e-ac04-a2725971e611", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c5fa1211bc80692f2f86df63a44dba216f193a39985638006a3cb764f0271570"}, "3": {"node_id": "b16a2e7b-9aa4-49fd-aee3-5d11b30e9728", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c3028ea59014b85e4a1823e7ebb4756679ff32b47b0c8d59ac38b1b6f415b6e5"}}, "hash": "f7a636bb92a4a18b23e31e81161c1857177b1835ec7d0dc51e29b06a7512aeb7", "text": "Malefics in angles and/or trines and benefics in Ari and/or Randhr Bhava, while Tanu Bhava has in it Randhr\u2019s Lord in fall: this Yoga will cause immediate end.

Within a month of birth, death will befall the child, if Randhr\u2019s  \nLord is in Randhr itself, while Candr is with malefics and be bereft of beneficial Drishti. 14-15. Long Life (again). One will be long-lived, if Lagn\u2019s Lord is in exaltation,  \nwhile Candr and Guru are, respectively, in Labh and Randhr Bhava. If Lagn\u2019s Lord is exceedingly strong and receives a Drishti from a benefic, which is placed in an  \nangle, the person concerned will be wealthy, virtuous and long-lived. \n \nCh. 20. Effects of Dharm Bhava \n \n(1) Combinations for Fortunes. O Brahmin, now listen to the effects of Dharm Bhava. One will be fortunate (or affluent), if Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Dharm Bhava with  \nstrength. (2) Should Guru be in Dharm Bhava, while Dharm\u2019s Lord is in an angle and Lagn\u2019s Lord is endowed with strength, one will be extremely fortunate. 3.  \nFortunate (Affluent) Father. If Dharm\u2019s Lord is with strength, as Sukr is in Dharm, while Guru is in an angle from Tanu Bhava, the native\u2019s father is fortunate. 4.  \nIndigent Father. If Dharm\u2019s Lord is debilitated, while the 2nd and/or the 4th from Dharm Bhava is occupied by Mangal, the native\u2019s father is poor. 5. Long-living  \nFather. Should Dharm\u2019s Lord be in deep exaltation, while Sukr is in an angle from Tanu Bhava and Guru is in the 9th from Navans Lagn, the father of the native will  \nenjoy a long span of life. 6. Royal Status for Father. If Dharm\u2019s Lord is an angle and receives a Drishti from Guru, the native\u2019s father will be a king endowed with  \nconveyances, or be equal to a king. 7. Wealthy and Famous Father. Should Dharm\u2019s Lord be in Karm Bhava, while Karm\u2019s Lord receives a Drishti from a benefic  \nthe native\u2019s father will be very rich and famous. 8-9. Virtuous and Devoted to Father. Should Surya be in deep exaltation, as Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Labh Bhava, the  \nnative will be virtuous, dear to the king and devoted to father. If Surya is in a trine from Lagna, while Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Yuvati in yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from  \nGuru, the native will be devoted to his father. 10. Fortunes etc. Acquisition of fortunes, conveyances and fame will follow the 32nd year of age, if Dharm\u2019s Lord is in  \nDhan, while Dhan\u2019s Lord is in Dharm. 11. Inimical to Father. There will be mutual enmity between the father and the native, if Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, but  \nwith the Lord of Ari. Further, the native\u2019s father will be of contemptible disposition. 12. Begged Food. If Karm\u2019s Lord and Sahaj\u2019s Lord are bereft of strength, while  \nDharm\u2019s Lord is in fall, or combust the native will go begging for his food. 13-25.

Combinations for Father\u2019s Death. The father of the native would have passed away  \nprior to the native\u2019s birth, if Surya is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, as Randhr\u2019s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, Vyaya\u2019s Lord is in Tanu Bhava and Ari\u2019s Lord is in Putr  \nBhava. Should Surya be in Randhr Bhava, while Randhr\u2019s Lord is in Dharm, the native\u2019s father will pass away within a year of his birth. If the Lord of Vyaya Bhava  \nis in Dharm Bhava, while Dharm\u2019s Lord is in its debilitation Navans, the native\u2019s father will face his end during the 3rd, or the 16th year of the native. Death of father  \nwill occur in the 2nd, or the 12th year, if Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, as Randhr\u2019s Lord is with Surya. Should Rahu be in the 8th from Dharm, as Surya is in the  \n9th from Dharm, death of father will take place in the 16th, or the 18th year of the native. If Sani is in the 9th from Candr, as Surya is with Rahu, the native\u2019s father  \nwill die in the 7th, or the 19th year of the native. The native in his 44th year will lose his father, if Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Vyaya, as Vyaya\u2019s Lord is in Dharm. If Lagn\u2019s  \nLord is in Randhr Bhava, as Candr is in Surya\u2019s Navans, the native in his 35th, or 41st year will lose his father. One will lose his father in the 50th year, if Surya,  \nbeing the Lord of Dharm, is conjunct Mangal and Sani. If Surya is in the 7th from Dharm Bhava, as Rahu is in the 7th from Sahaj Bhava, the 6th, or 25th year of the  \nnative will be fatal for father. If Sani is in the 7th from Randhr Bhava, as Surya is in the 7th from Sani, the ages of 21, 26, or 30 will be fatal for the father. If Dharm\u2019s  \nLord is in its debilitation Rashi, while his dispositor is in Dharm Bhava, the native will lose his father at the age of 26, or 30. Thus the Jyotishis may know the effects.  \n26. Fortunes. One will enjoy abundant fortunes, if Sukr is in deep exaltation and be in the company of Dharm\u2019s Lord, as Sani is in Sahaj. 27-28. Fortunate Periods.  \nAbundant fortunes be acquired after the 20th year, if Dharm has Guru in it, as its Lord is in an angle from Lagn. Should Budh be in his deep exaltation, as Dharm\u2019s  \nLord is in Dharm itself, abundant fortunes will be earned after the 36th year. 29.

Should Sani be in Dharm Bhava along with Candr, as Lagn\u2019s Lord is in fall, the native will  \nacquire food by begging. 32. O Brahmin, these are the effects related to Dharm Bhava. I have explained briefly. These may be estimated with the help of the state  \nof the Lords of Lagn and Dharm Bhava and in other manners as well. \n \nCh. 21. Effects of Karm Bhava 1. \n \nI now explain the effects of Karm Bhava. Listen to these, o Maitreya, in the words of Brahma, Garga and others. 2. Paternal Happiness. If Karm\u2019s Lord is strong and  \nin exaltation, or in its own Rashi/Navans, the native will derive extreme paternal happiness, will enjoy fame and will perform good deeds. 3. If Karm\u2019s Lord is devoid  \nof strength, the native will face obstructions in his work. If Rahu is in an angle, or in a trine, he will perform religious sacrifices, like Jyotishtoma. 4. If Karm\u2019s Lord is  \nwith a benefic, or be in an auspicious Bhava, one will always gain through royal patronage and in business. In a contrary situation, only opposite results will come to  \npass. 5. Should Karm and Labh Bhava be both occupied by malefics, the native will indulge only in bad deeds and will defile his own men. 6. If the Lord of Karm  \nBhava is relegated to Randhr Bhava along with Rahu, the native will hate others; be a great fool and will do bad deeds. 7. If Sani, Mangal and Karm\u2019s Lord are in  \nYuvati, as Yuvati\u2019s Lord is with a malefic, the native will be fond of carnal pleasures and of filling his belly. 8-10 Should Karm\u2019s Lord be in exaltation and be in the  \ncompany of Guru, as Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Karm the native will be endowed with honour, wealth and valour. One will lead a happy life, if Labh\u2019s Lord is in Karm and  \nKarm\u2019s Lord is in Lagn, or, if the Lord of Karm Bhava is yuti with the Lord of Labh Bhava in an angle. Should Karm\u2019s Lord in strength be in Meen along Guru, the  \nnative will doubtless obtain robes, ornaments and happiness. 11. Should Rahu, Surya, Sani and Mangal be in Labh Bhava, the native will incur cessation of his  \nduties. 12. One will be learned and wealthy, if Guru is in Meen along with Sukr, while Lagn\u2019s Lord is strong and Candr is in exaltation. 13. Should Karm\u2019s Lord be in  \nLabh, while Labh\u2019s Lord is in Tanu Bhava and Sukr is in Karm, the native will be endowed with precious stones. 14. If the Karm\u2019s Lord is exalted in an angle, or a  \ntrine and is yuti with Guru, or receives a Drishti from Guru, one will be endowed with deeds. 15. Should Karm\u2019s Lord be in Lagn along with Lagn\u2019s Lord, as Candr is  \nin an angle, or in a trine, the native will be interested in good deeds. 16. If Sani is in Karm Bhava along with a debilitated Grah, while Karm Bhava in the Navans  \nKundali is occupied by a malefic, the native will be bereft of acts. 17. One will indulge in bad acts, if Karm\u2019s Lord is in Randhr Bhava, while Randhr\u2019s Lord is in Karm  \nBhava with a malefic. 18.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c333509e-7b7d-497d-ae10-cae525ac4372": {"__data__": {"id_": "c333509e-7b7d-497d-ae10-cae525ac4372", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73d57b23-cabd-48e3-b1cf-a01f07fe650a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "e584f04f413b6dc1e8921bad49b4445f3ab45e67ddd20d1c679e14ac3f263320"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4cecd33-0a9a-4e9e-b30f-dbc4fc868058", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "325ad9985e99457935a91bf67c31acf23e0d70e510a5b9cd9acde8d76bc3ea56"}, "3": {"node_id": "947626df-883f-45c4-a8ed-744ee93acb74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "a409e96ab0d5dbb87f91bc235e4ad600cff2b5436c07bf66b53bc1b412df0070"}}, "hash": "8883f4c8e62c1f3a0fc6421935396dcaa3ed73bfcce5bb9f6428c0c2423ec8c8", "text": "18.

One will be endowed with fame, if Candr is in Karm Bhava, while Karm\u2019s Lord is in a trine from Karm Bhava and  \nLagn\u2019s Lord is in Lagn\u2019s angle. Similar effects will come to pass, if Labh\u2019s Lord is in Karm Bhava, while Karm\u2019s Lord is strong and gives a Drishti to Guru. Fame will  \ncome to the native, if Karm\u2019s Lord is in Dharm Bhava, as Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Karm Bhava and Candr is in Putr Bhava. 22. O excellent of the Brahmins, thus have  \nbeen told about the effects of Karm Bhava in a brief manner. Other related effects be guessed by you based on the relationship of the Lords of Lagn and of Karm  \nBhava. \n \nCh. 22. Effects of Labh Bhava \n \n1. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now explain effects relating to Labh Bhava, the auspiciousness of which Bhava will make one happy at all times. 2. Should Labh\u2019s  \nLord be in Labh itself, or be in an angle, or in a trine from Lagn, there will be many gains. Similarly, if Labh\u2019s Lord is exalted, though in combustion there will be  \nmany gains. 3. If Labh\u2019s Lord is in Dhan Bhava, while Dhan\u2019s Lord is in an angle along with Guru, the gains will be great. 4. If Labh\u2019s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, while  \nLabh Bhava is occupied by a benefic, the native will gain 2000 Nishkas in his 36th year. 5. If Labh\u2019s Lord is yuti with a benefic in an angle, or in a trine, the native  \nwill acquire 500 Nishkas in his 40th year. 6. The native will own 6000 Nishkas, if Labh Bhava is occupied by Guru, while Dhan Bhava and Dharm Bhava are,  \nrespectively, taken over by Candr and Sukr by position. 7. Should Guru, Budh and Candr be in the 11th from Labh, the native will be endowed with wealth, grains,  \nfortunes, diamonds, ornaments etc. 8. One will gain 1000 Nishkas in his 33rd year, if Labh\u2019s Lord is in Lagn and Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Labh Bhava. 9. If Labh\u2019s Lord is in  \nDhan Bhava, as Dhan\u2019s Lord is in Labh Bhava, one will amass abundant fortunes after marriage. 10. If Labh\u2019s Lord is in Sahaj Bhava, as Sahaj\u2019s Lord is in Labh  \nBhava, one will gain wealth through co-borns and will be endowed with excellent ornaments. 11. There will be no gains in spite of numerous efforts, if Labh\u2019s Lord is  \nin fall, in combustion, or be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava with a malefic. \n \nCh. 23. Effects of Vyaya Bhava \n \n1-4. O Brahmin, now I tell you about the effects of Vyaya Bhava. There will be expenses on good accounts, if Vyaya\u2019s Lord is with a benefic, or in his own Bhava, or  \nexalted, or, if a benefic occupies Vyaya. One will own beautiful houses and beds and be endowed with superior scented articles and pleasures, if Candr happens to  \nbe Vyaya\u2019s Lord and be exalted, or be in its own Rashi and/or Navans, or in Labh/Dharm/Putr Bhava in Rashi/Navans. The said native will live with rich clothes and  \nornaments, be learned and Lordly. 5-6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "947626df-883f-45c4-a8ed-744ee93acb74": {"__data__": {"id_": "947626df-883f-45c4-a8ed-744ee93acb74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73d57b23-cabd-48e3-b1cf-a01f07fe650a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "e584f04f413b6dc1e8921bad49b4445f3ab45e67ddd20d1c679e14ac3f263320"}, "2": {"node_id": "c333509e-7b7d-497d-ae10-cae525ac4372", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "8883f4c8e62c1f3a0fc6421935396dcaa3ed73bfcce5bb9f6428c0c2423ec8c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "8044bfa5-f152-4eb2-bfcb-acc9203e52a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "bc705f2ade1d4466156457f0865eeeba2a695b9463b226ab87fd8ec2ec33e3da"}}, "hash": "a409e96ab0d5dbb87f91bc235e4ad600cff2b5436c07bf66b53bc1b412df0070", "text": "5-6.

If he be in an angle, or trine, the native will beget a  \nspouse. 7. Just as these effects are derived from Tanu Bhava in regard to the native, similar deductions be made about co-borns etc. from Sahaj and other Bhavas.  \n8. Grahas placed in the visible half of the zodiac will give explicit results, while the ones in the invisible half will confer secret results. 9.

O Brahmin, these are the effects for Dhum etc. Before declaring these results, the effects of Surya and other Grahas should be wisely conceived by their  \npositions, relations and Drishtis apart from their strength, or weakness. \n \nCh. 26. Evaluation of Drishtis of Grahas \n \n1. O Glorious, it is said, that Drishtis (of Grahas) and their strengths are to be known in deciding the effects. How many kinds are these? Please clarify doubts. 2-5.  \nDrishtis of the Grahas. O Brahmin, I have earlier stated Drishtis, based on Rashis. The other kind is between Grahas, which I detail below. 3rd and 10th, 5th and  \n9th, 4th and 8th and lastly 7th. On these places the Drishtis increase gradually in slabs of quarters, i.e \u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be and full. The effects will also be proportionate. All  \nGrahas give a Drishti to the 7th fully. Sani, Guru and Mangal have special Drishtis, respectively, on the 3rd and the 10th, the 5th and the 9th and the 4th and the  \n8th. The ancient preceptors have explained these, which ordinary. By subtle mathematical calculations these Drishtis will have to be clearly understood, as under.  \n6-8. Evaluation of the Drishtis of the Grahas. Deduct the longitude of the Grah (or Bhava), that receives a Drishti, from that of the Grah, which gives the Drishti. If  \nthe sum exceeds six Rashis, deduct the sum again from 10 Rashis. Convert the latter sum into degrees and divide by two. The resultant product is Drishti Kona (or  \naspectual angle). If the difference is in excess of 5 Rashis, ignore the Rashis and multiply the degrees etc. by 2, which is the value of the Drishti. If the difference is  \nin excess of 4 Rashis, deduct it from 5 Rashis, and the resultant degees etc. become the Drishti value. If the difference is in excess of 3 Rashis, deduct it from 4  \nRashis and (increase 30 by) halve the product to get the Drishti value. If the difference is above 2 Rashis, ignore the Rashis and add 15 to the degrees etc. to get  \nthe Drishti value. If it is in excess of one Rashi, ignore the Rashis and divide the degrees by 2 to get the Drishti value. 9-10. Special consideration for Sani\u2019s  \nDrishtis. O Brahmin, if Sani is the Grah, that gives a Drishti, find out the difference between him and the Grah, that receives the Drishti; if the sum is above 1 Rashi,  \nmultiply the degrees etc. by 2 to get the Drishti value. If the sum is above nine Rashis, the degrees to elapse be doubled to get the Drishti value. If the sum is above  \n2 Rashis, the degrees etc. be halved and deducted from 60. If the sum exceeds 8 Rashis, add to the degrees etc. a figure of 30 to get the Drishti value. In other  \ncases, the sums be processed, as explained earlier. 11. Special consideration for Mangal\u2019s Drishtis. Deduct the longitude of Mangal from that of the Grah, that  \nreceives the Drishti. If the sum is 3 Rashis & c, or 7 Rashis & c, the degrees etc. be reduced from 60. If it is above 2 Rashis, the degrees etc. be increased by half  \nof it and superadd 15.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8303e3b0-7508-42cd-b5e9-9c58d04ccae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8303e3b0-7508-42cd-b5e9-9c58d04ccae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b3bb13b-ae86-40a0-b13e-9bde38f37483", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b38ab77888c270d9e6a10407291d45f84ad5d8538655d3e2a9d296a8e718399c"}, "2": {"node_id": "db823676-6e99-4339-8e34-572baef2a227", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "1174ba4b151e1907ad0b33a2914ebec2ec9edafc379ef0af8e57fb745b47beed"}, "3": {"node_id": "2841e64a-475c-4d34-91af-a3b86005f018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "f0675d0dd71684e0cb6a6181bf8b8a1c6baf120e700fdd8371bbbde6d4bb39be"}}, "hash": "e846b7e0613745ef35ed6a8f69c9b2cb993f023b41e4c2ff3b81eeb240f31d1c", "text": "be increased by half  \nof it and superadd 15.

Evaluation Of Strengths \n \nShad Bal consists of the following: Sthan Bal (positional), Dig Bal (directional), Kaal Bal (Temporal), inclusive of Ayan Bal (equinoctial), Chesht Bal (motional),  \nNaisargika Bal (natural), Drik Bal (aspectual). These strengths are computed for the seven Grahas from Surya to Sani. The nodes are not considered. Sthan Bal  \ncomprises of the following considerations: Uchch Bal (exaltation), Sapt Vargaj Bal (strength accruing out of positions in Rashi, Hora, Dreshkan, Saptans, Navans,  \nDvadashans and Trimshans), OjhayugmaRashians Bal (acquired by placement in odd, or even Rashi and in odd, or even Navans), Kendradi Bal (due to placement  \nin Kon, or Panaphara, or Apoklima Bhava), Dreshkan Bal (due to placement in first, second, or third decanate of a Rashi). Kaal Bal comprises of the following  \nsubdivisions: Nathonnata Bal (diurnal and nocturnal), Paksh Bal (fortnight), Tribhag Bal (due to day/night being made in 3 parts), Varsh, Maas, Dina and Hora Bal  \n(Varsh - astrological year, Maas - month, Dina - weekday and Hora - planetary hour), Ayan Bal (equinoctial), Yudhdh Bal (due to partaking in war between Grahas).  \n1-1\u00bd. Sthan Bal (up to Sloka 6). Firstly Uchch Bal. Now about the strengths by classes positional, temporal etc. Deduct from the longitude of the Grah its (deep)  \ndebilitation point. If the sum is less than 6 Rashis, consider it, as it is; if it exceeds 6 Rashis, deduct the same from 12 Rashis. The sum so got be converted into  \ndegrees etc. and divided by 3, which is the Grah\u2019s Uchch Bal in Virupas. 2-4. Sapt Vargaj Bal. If a Grah is in its Mooltrikon Rashi, it gets 45 Virupas, in Svasth  \nRashi 30 Virupas, in Pramudit Rashi 20 Virupas, in Shant Rashi 15 Virupas, in Din Rashi 10 Virupas, in Duhkhit Rashi 4 Virupas and in Khal Rashi 2 Virupas.  \nSimilarly these values occur for the other 6 divisional occupations, viz. Hora, Dreshkan, Saptans, Navans, Dvadashans and Trimshans. When all these are added  \ntogether the Grah\u2019s Sapt Vargaj Bal emerges. 4\u00bd. OjhayugmaRashians Bal.

One Rupa is obtained by Budh in the first 1/3 part of day time, by Surya in the second 1/3 part of  \nthe day and by Sani in the last 1/3 part of the day. Similarly Candr, Sukr and Mangal get full Bal in the first, second and last 1/3 parts of the night. Guru gets this Bal  \nat all times. 13. Varsh-Maas-Dina-Hora Bal. 15, 30, 45 and 60 Virupas are in order given to Varsh Lord, Maas Lord, Dina Lord and Hora Lord. Naisargika Bal has  \nalready been explained. The Varsh Lord is the Lord of the day, on which the astrological year of birth starts. To calculate this we first need the number of days, past  \nfrom the beginning of Creation, the Ahargan. According to late Rev. Ebenezer Burgess, who translated Surya Siddhanta in English, as on January 1, 1860, the  \nnumber of days, past from the beginning of Creation are 714,404,108,573. Divide the number of days, past from the day of Creation till the day of birth, by 60.  \nReject remainder and multiply the quotient by 3. Increase the post-multiplied product by 1 and divide by 7. The remainder will indicate the week day, on which the  \nastrological year, giving birth to the native, opened. Remainder 1 indicates Sunday, 2 Monday and so on. Maas Lord. Divide the same Ahargan by 30 and the  \nquotient indicates months, passed from Creation to birth. The completed months be multiplied by 2 and increased by 1. The latter sum should be divided by 7 and  \nthe remainder indicates, on which day the birth month began. Continuing with the same case, we divide 65295 by 30. Quotient is 2176. This sum multiplied by 2  \nand increased by 1 denotes 4353. Dividing 4353 by 7, we get a remainder of 6, denoting Friday. That is, the month of birth began on Friday and the Maas Bal goes  \nto Sukr, the Lord of Friday. Dina Lord. Though the week day of birth can be known from ephemeris, or perpetual calendars, we better adopt the method prescribed,  \nwhich will confirm, if the Ahargan followed is correct. The number of days, as arrived above, indicating Ahargan, be divided by 7 and the remainder will indicate the  \nweek day of birth. Hora Bal. Hora means planetary hour.

Convert this to Rashi, degrees, minutes and seconds. If Candr and Sani are in Tula, or ahead, add to this 3 Rashis and, if in Mesh to Kanya, reduce from  \nthis 3 Rashis. Similarly it is reverse for Surya, Mangal, Sukr and Guru. For Budh 3 Rashis are always additive. The resultant sum in Rashi, degrees and minutes be  \ndivided by 3 to get the Ayan Bal in Rupas. Notes. Ayan Bal can be found out on the following simple formula: Ayan Bal = 60*(23\u00b027\u2019 + Kranti)/(46\u00b054\u2019) = (23\u00b027\u2019\u00b1  \nKranti)*1.2793. The following points have to be remembered in respect of Krantis. When Candr, or Sani have southern Kranti, or, when Surya, Mangal, Guru, or  \nSukr have northern Kranti, take plus. In a contrary situation in respect of these 6 Grahas, take minus. As far as Budh is concerned, it is always plus. Krantis (or  \ndeclinations) can be ascertained from a standard modern ephemeris. Surya\u2019s Ayan Bal is again multiplied by 2 whereas for others the product arrived in Virupas is  \nconsidered, as it is. 18. Motional Strength for Surya and Candr. Surya\u2019s Chesht Bal will correspond to his Ayan Bal. Candr\u2019s Paksh Bal will itself be her Chesht Bal.  \n19. Drik Bal. Reduce one fourth of the Drishti Pinda, if a Grah receives malefic Drishtis and add a fourth, if it receives a Drishti from a benefic. Super add the entire  \nDrishti of Budh and Guru to get the net strength of a Grah. 20. War Between Grahas. Should there be a war between the starry Grahas, the difference between the  \nShad Balas of the two should be added to the victor\u2019s Shad Bal and deducted from the Shad Bal of the vanquished. 21-23. Motions of Grahas (Mangal to Sani).  \nEight kinds of motions are attributed to Grahas. These are Vakr (retrogression), Anuvakr (entering the previous Rashi in retrograde motion), Vikal (devoid of  \nmotion), Mand (somewhat slower motion than usual), Mandatar (slower than the previous), Sama (somewhat increasing in motion), Char (faster than Sama) and  \nAtichar (entering next Rashi in accelerated motion). The strengths, allotted due to such 8 motions are 60, 30, 15, 30, 15, 7.5, 45 and 30. 24-25. Motional Strength  \nfor Mangal etc. Add together the mean and true longitudes of a Grah and divide the one by two. Reduce this sum from the Seeghroch (or apogee) of the Grah. The  \nresultant product will indicate the Chesht Kendra (or Seeghr Kendra) of the Grah from 12 Rashis. The Rashi, degrees and minutes so arrived should be converted  \ninto degrees, minutes etc. and divided by 3, which will denote the motional strength of the Grah. Thus there are six sources of strength, called Sthan Bal, Dig Bal,  \nKaal Bal, Drik Bal, Chesht Bal and Naisargika Bal. 26-29. Bhava Balas. Thus I explained about the strengths of the Grahas. Deduct Yuvati Bhava from the Bhava, if  \nthe Bhava happens to be in Kanya, Mithun, Tula, Kumbh, or the first half of Dhanu. If Mesh, Vrishabh, Simh, or first half of Makar, or the second half of Dhanu  \nhappen to be the Bhava, deduct Bandhu Bhava from it. Should the Bhava be in Kark, or in Vrischik, deduct from it Lagn.

The product after  \ndivision should be increased by one fourth, if the Bhava in question receives a benefic Drishti. If the Bhava receives a malefic Drishti, one fourth should be reduced.  \nIf Guru, or Budh give a Drishti to a Bhava, add that Grah\u2019s Drik Bal also. And then superadd the strength, acquired by the Lord of that Bhava. This will be the net  \nBhava Bal. 30-31. Special Rules. The Bhavas, occupied by Guru and Budh will each get an addition of 1 Rupa, while each of the Bhavas, occupied by Sani,  \nMangal and Surya, suffer 1 Rupa reduction. 15 Virupas will have to be added to the Bhavas, falling in Seershodaya Rashis, if birth happens to be in day time, to the  \nBhavas, falling in Dual Rashis, if birth happens to be in twilight and to the Bhavas, falling in Prishtodaya Rashis, if birth be in night time. 32-33. Shad Bal  \nRequirements. 390, 360, 300, 420, 390, 330 and 300 Virupas are the Shad Bal Pindas, needed for Surya etc. to be considered strong. If the strength exceeds the  \nabove-mentioned values, the Grah is deemed to be very strong. If a Grah has the required Shad Bal, it will prove favourable to the native by virtue of its strength.  \nHowever, Sani\u2019s extreme strength will give long life as well as miseries. 34-36. Guru, Budh and Surya are strong, if each of their Sthan Bal, Dig Bal, Kaal Bal,  \nChesht Bal and Ayan Bal are, respectively, 165, 35, 50, 112 and 30 Virupas. The same required for Candr and Sukr are 133, 50, 30, 100 and 40. For Mangal and  \nSani these are 96, 30, 40, 67 and 20. 37-38. Bhava Effects. O Brahmin, thus the various sources of strengths be gathered together and effects declared. Whatever  \nYogas, or effects have been stated with respect to a Bhava, will come to pass through the strongest Grah. 39-40. Eligibility of Issue Fruitful Predictions. O Maitreya,  \nthe words of one, who has achieved skill in mathematics, one, who has put in industrious efforts in the branch of grammar, one, who has knowledge of justice, one,  \nwho is intelligent, one, who has knowledge of geography, space and time, one, who has conquered his senses, one, who is skilfully logical (in estimation) and one,  \nwho is favourable to Jyotish, will doubtless be truthful. \n \nCh. 28. Isht and Kasht Balas \n \n1. Now I narrate the benefic and malefic tendencies of the Grahas, based on which the Dasha effects can be decided. 2. Exaltation Rays. Deduct the Grah\u2019s  \ndebilitation point from its actual position. If the sum exceeds 6 Rashis, deduct from 12 Rashis. The said sum should then be increased by 1 Rashi. The degrees etc.  \nbe multiplied by 2, which, when considered along with Rashis, will indicate the Uchch Rasmi of the Grah. 3-4. Chesht Rasmi. Chesht Rasmis are to be calculated  \nfrom Chesht Kendr similar to Uchch Rasmi computations. The Chesht Kendras of Grahas from Mangal to Sani have already been explained. Add 3 Rashis to  \nSayan Surya (i.e. with Ayanans), which will be the Chesht Kendr for Surya.

The result will be auspicious rays  \n(Subh Rasmis). Deduct from 8 the Subh Rasmis to obtain inauspicious rays (Asubh Rasmis). 6. Isht and Kasht Tendencies. Reduce 1 from each of Chesht Rasmi  \nand Uchch Rasmi. Then multiply the products by 10 and add together. Half of the sum will represent the Isht Phala (benefic tendency) of the Grah.

A Grah is considered auspicious in the first five of the said places. In the sixth place it is neutral, i.e. neither good nor bad. And in the other three  \nplaces it is inauspicious. 11-12. Nature of Effects, due to Dig Bal etc. The directional strength of a Grah is itself representative of the effects, due to the direction;  \nand Kaal Bal itself is indicative of effects, due to the day. Whatever quantum of Dig Bal etc. are obtained by a Grah, will be the extent of auspicious effects,  \nacquirable on account of that strength. Deducting those figures from 60, the extent of inauspiciousness is known. If auspiciousness is more in the case of a Grah\u2019s  \nstrength, the Dasha and Bhavas, related to that Grah will be auspicious. These are converse, if inauspiciousness is predominant. 13-14. Sapt Varg Phal and Isht  \nand Kasht (Continued).

Auspicious, or inauspicious aspect will be by multiplying the Subh, or Asubh Pankthi. Similarly auspicious, or inauspicious effects will be  \nknown by multiplying the auspicious, or inauspicious strength by the respective Pankthi. 15-20. Effects of a Bhava. The strength of a Bhava and its Lord have  \nalready been explained. The actual effects will be a combination of Bhava strength and its Lord\u2019s strength. If there is a benefic in the Bhava add the same to the  \nauspicious effects and deduct from inauspicious effects, which will denote the inauspicious effects. If a malefic is in the Bhava, reverse the process, i.e. add  \ninauspicious effects and deduct auspicious effects. Similarly Drishtis and Balas.

Method of Bhava Calculation. O Brahmin, I shall now tell you about the Padas (Arudhas) for Bhavas and Grahas as well, as laid down by the earlier  \nMaharishis. The Pad of Lagn will correspond to the Rashi, arrived at by counting so many Rashis from Lagn\u2019s Lord, as he is away from Tanu Bhava. Similarly  \nPadas for other Bhavas be known through their Lords. The word \u201cPad\u201d exclusively denotes the Pad for Lagn. Names of the 12 Arudhas are Lagn Pad - Arudh of  \nTanu Bhava, Dhan of Dhan, Vikram (Bhratru) of Sahaj, Matru (Sukh) of Bandhu, Mantra (Putr) of Putr, Rog (Satru) of Ari, Dar (Kalatr) of Yuvati, Maran of Randhr,  \nPitru of Dharm Bhava, Karm of Karm, Labh of Labh, Vyaya of Vyaya. 4-5. Special Exceptions. The same Bhava, or the 7th from it does not become its Pad. When  \nthe Pad falls in the same Bhava, the 10th therefrom be treated, as its Pad.

If the ruler of a Bhava be in the 4th from the Bhava, then the very Bhava occupied be noted, as the Pad. 6-7. Padas for Grahas.  \nNote the position of a Grah and see how many Rashis away is its own Rashi with reference to its position. Count so many Rashis from the said own Rashi and the  \nresultant Rashi will become the Arudh of the Grah. If a Grah owns two Rashis, or, if a Rashi is owned by two Grahas; consider the stronger and declare effects  \naccordingly. 8-11. Pad and Finance (up to Sloka 15). O Brahmin, I now tell you of some effects of Grahas, based on Pad. If the 11th from Lagn Pad is occupied, or  \nreceives a Drishti from a Grah the native will be happy and rich; wealth will come through various means, if a benefic is related, as above. A malefic will confer  \nwealth through questionable means. If there be both a benefic and a malefic, it will be through both means. If the Grah in question be in exaltation, or in own Rashi  \netc., there will be plenty of gains and plenty of happiness. 12. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the 12th from Lagn Pad does not receive a Drishti, as the 11th from  \nLagn Pad receives a Drishti from a Grah, then the gains will be uninterrupted. 13-15. O Brahmin, the quantum of gains will correspond to the number of Grahas in,  \nor giving a Drishti to the 11th from Lagn Pad. If there is Argala for the said 11th, there will be more gains, while a benefic Argala will bring still more gains. If the said  \nbenefic, causing Argala is in his exaltation Rashi, the gains will be still higher. If the said 11th receives a Drishti from a benefic from Lagn, the 9th etc., gains will  \nincrease in the ascending order. In all these cases, the 12th from Pad should simultaneously be free from malefic association. A benefic, placed in Lagn, giving a  \nDrishti to the 11th from Arudh Lagn will be still beneficial. If the Drishti is from the 9th from Lagn, it will confer much more gains. 16-17. Pad and Financial Losses  \n(up to Sloka 21). If the 12th from Lagn Pad receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with both benefics and malefics, there will be abundant earnings, but plenty of  \nexpenses. The benefic will cause through fair means, malefic through unfair means and mixed Grahas through both fair and unfair means. 18. If the 12th from Lagn  \nPad is conjunct Surya, Sukr and Rahu, there will be loss of wealth through the king. Candr, giving a Drishti to (the said trio in the said Bhava), will specifically cause  \nmore such losses. 19. If Budh is in the 12th from Lagn Pad and is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic, similarly there will be expenses through paternal  \nrelatives. A malefic so related to the said Budh will cause loss of wealth through disputes. 20. O Brahmin, if Guru is in the 12th from Lagn Pad, receiving a Drishti  \nfrom others, the expenses will be through taxes and on the person himself. 21. O Brahmin, if Sani is in the 12th from Lagn Pad along with Mangal and receives a  \nDrishti from others, the expenses will be through one\u2019s co-born. 22. Gainful Sources. Whatever sources of expenses are indicated above with reference to the 12th  \nfrom Lagn Pad, gains through similar sources will occur, if Labh Bhava so features with reference to Lagn Pad. 23. The 7th Bhava from Pad (up to Sloka 27). If  \nRahu, or Ketu is placed in the 7th from Lagn Pad, the native will be troubled by disorders of the stomach, or by fire. 24.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4213d35-7e68-44d2-a336-0b4c3c8bccbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4213d35-7e68-44d2-a336-0b4c3c8bccbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8bf837f-4b14-4486-9bc3-e23de92b91bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "375f94d8f8d8afccd19226c47de9e944ca60975a2258ff58892417432c976a5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "27729fbb-e8c1-4918-bf95-2d4e7f73ab7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "90f80aa2b28249837c30ce5176f3822abcfee3adb6235005e9c650c64bf31116"}, "3": {"node_id": "fea280c7-4247-40e6-a8ba-498caa4f449f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "076e8330bcbc3359685d89d9f3ca82a123e16eb7be4f877cc84906191e242f2b"}}, "hash": "bfa5c6035b3266b0fe97ce4a8bd488d659ccd4b1bf7daddef9f3bad8aac35967", "text": "24. Should there be Ketu in the 7th from Lagn  \nPad, receiving a Drishti from, or being yuti with another malefic, the native will be adventurous, will have (prematurely) grey hair and a big male organ. 25. Should  \none, two, or all three of Guru, Sukr and Candr be in the 7th from Lagn Pad, the native will be very wealthy. 26. Whether a benefic, or a malefic, if be exalted in the  \n7th from Lagn Pad, the native will be affluent and be famous. 27. O Brahmin, these Yogas, as narrated by me with reference to the 7th from Lagn Pad, should also  \nbe considered from the 2nd of Lagn Pad. 28. Anyone of Budh, Guru and Sukr being exalted in the 2nd from Lagn Pad and being with strength will make the subject  \nrich. 29. The Yogas so far stated by me with reference to Lagn Pad be similarly evaluated from Karakans as well. 30-37. General. If Budh is in the 2nd from Arudh  \nLagn, the native will Lord over the whole country. Sukr in the 2nd from Lagn Pad will make one a poet, or a speaker. If the Dar Pad falls in an angle, or in a trine,  \ncounted from Lagn Pad, or, if Lagn Pad and Dar Pad both have strong Grahas, the native will be rich and be famous in his country. If the Dar Pad falls in the 6th/  \n8th/12th from Lagn Pad, then the native will be poor. If Lagn Pad and the 7th therefrom, or an angle, a trine, an Upachaya therefrom is occupied by a strong Grah,  \nthere will be happiness between the husband and wife. If Lagn Pad and Dar Pad are mutually in Kendras, or Konas, there will be amity between the couple. If these  \nbe in mutually 6th/8th/12th, doubtlessly mutual enmity will crop up. O Brahmin, similarly mutual relationship, or gain, or loss through son etc. be known, based on  \nLagn Pad and the relative Bhava Pad. If Lagn Pad and Dar Pad are mutually angular, or 3rd and 11th, or in Konas, the native will be a king, ruling the earth. Similar  \ndeductions be made with reference to mutual positions of Lagn Pad and Dhan Pad. \n \nCh. 30. Upa Pad \n \n1-6. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Upa Pad, the auspiciousness of which will confer on the native happiness from progeny, wife etc. The Pad of Lagn, as  \ndiscussed earlier, is of prime importance. Upa Pad is calculated for the Bhava, following the natal Lagn. This Upa Pad is also called Gaun Pad. O excellent of the  \nBrahmins, if Upa Pad is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic Grah, one will obtain full happiness from progeny and spouse. Should the Upa Pad be in a  \nmalefic\u2019s Rashi, or receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a malefic, one will become an ascetic and go without a wife. If (in the said circumstances) there be a  \nbenefic Drishti (on Upa Pad, or the related malefic), or a yuti, deprival of spouse will not come to pass. In this case Surya, being exalted, or in a friendly Rashi, is  \nnot a malefic. He is a malefic, if in debilitation, or in an enemy\u2019s Rashi. Notes. Regarding Upa Pad calculations, there are more than two views on the same Sloka of  \nMaharishi Parashar, or an identical Sutra from Jaimini. In this text, the word \u2018Anuchar\u2019 is used, which denotes \u2018the Bhava, following the Lagn at birth\u2019.

However, when we study other commentaries on Jaimini (Chaukhambh Hindi edition), we are taught, that it is Vyaya Bhava in the case of an odd  \nRashi ascending and it is Dhan Bhava in the case of an even Rashi ascending. Accordingly the Pad for the 12th, or the 2nd from Lagn is called Upa Pad. In  \ncalculating Upa Pad the rules mentioned in verses 4 and 5 of the previous chapter be kept in mind. 7-12. Effect from the 2nd from Upa Pad. If the 2nd from Upa  \nPad is a benefic Rashi, or receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic, the same good results (as for wife and sons) will come to pass. If there is a Grah in the  \n2nd from Upa Pad in its debilitation Rashi, or debilitation Ans, or is yuti with a debilitated, or malefic Grah, there will be destruction of wife. If the said occupant be in  \nits exaltation Rashi, or Navans, or receives a Drishti from another Grah, there will be many charming and virtuous wives. Oh Brahmin, if Mithun happens to be the  \n2nd from Upa Pad, then also there will be many wives. O excellent of the Brahmins, if the Upa Pad, or the 2nd therefrom be occupied by its own Lord, or, if the said  \nLord is in his other own Bhava, the death of wife will be at advanced age. 13-15. Wife from the 2nd of Upa Pad (up to Sloka 22). If a Grah being constant indicator  \nof wife (i.e. the 7th Lord, or Sukr) is in its own Bhava, there will be loss of wife only at a later stage. If the Lord of Upa Pad, or the constant significator of wife is in  \nexaltation, the wife will be from a noble family. Reverse will be the case, if he is debilitated. O Brahmin, if the 2nd from Upa Pad is related to a benefic, the wife will  \nbe beautiful, fortunate and virtuous. 16. Should Sani and Rahu be in the 2nd from Upa Pad, the native will lose his wife on account of calumny, or through death.  \n17. The native\u2019s wife will be troubled by disorder of blood, leucorrhoea (Pradar) etc., if Sukr and Ketu are in the 2nd from Upa Pad. 18. Budh with Ketu in the 2nd  \nfrom Upa Pad will cause breakage of bones, while Rahu, Sani and Surya will cause distress of bones. 19-22. Budh and Rahu in the 2nd from Upa Pad will give a  \nstout-bodied wife. If the 2nd from Upa Pad happens to be one of Budh\u2019s Rashis and is tenanted by Mangal and Sani, the wife of the native will suffer from nasal  \ndisorders. Similarly a Rashi of Mangal, becoming the 2nd from Upa Pad and occupied by Mangal and Sani, will cause nasal disorders to one\u2019s wife. Guru and Sani  \nwill, if be in the 2nd from Upa Pad, cause disorders of ears and/or eyes to the wife. If Budh and Mangal are placed in the 2nd from Upa Pad other than their own  \nRashis, or, if Rahu is with Guru in the 2nd from Upa Pad, the native\u2019s wife will suffer from dental disorders. Sani and Rahu together in one of Sani\u2019s Rashis, which is  \nthe 2nd from Upa Pad, will cause lameness, or windy disorders to the native\u2019s wife. These evils will not come to pass, if there happens to be a Yuti with, or a Drishti  \nfrom a benefic (or from another benefic in the case of affliction being caused by a benefic himself). 23-23\u00bd.

About Sons. If Sani, Candr and Budh are together in the 9th from  \none of the said places (Sloka 23), there will be no son at all, while Surya, Guru and Rahu so placed will give a number of sons. Candr so placed will give a son,  \nwhile a mixture of Grahas will delay the obtainment of a son. The son, caused by the Yuti of Surya, Guru and Rahu, will be strong, valorous, greatly successful and  \nwill destroy enemies. If Mangal and Sani are in the said 9th, there will be no son, or a son will be obtained by adoption, or brother\u2019s son will come in adoption.

These are the effects, o Brahmin, as stated by Maharishis for the 3rd and  \nthe 11th from Lagn Pad.

Maitreya, I  \nexplain below Argala to know the definite effects of Bhavas and Grahas. Grahas in the 4th, 2nd and the 11th cause Argalas, while obstructors of the Argala will be  \nthose in the 10th, 12th and 3rd from a Bhava, or a Grah. If the Argala causing Grah is stronger than the obstructing one, the former will prevail. Or, if the number of  \nArgalas are more than the obstructing Grahas, then also the Argala will prevail. If there are 3, or more malefics in the 3rd they will cause Vipreet Argala (more  \neffective intervention), which will also be harmless and be very favourable. The 5th is also an Argala place, while the Grah in the 9th will counteract such Argala. As  \nRahu and Ketu have retrograde motions, the Argalas and obstructions be also counted accordingly in a reverse manner. Maharishis say, that the Argala, caused by  \none Grah, will yield limited effect, by two medium and by more than two, excellent effects. Argalas should be counted from a Rashi, or a Grah, as the case may be.  \nThe Argala, which is unobstructed will be fruitful, while the one duly obstructed will go astray. The Argala effects will be derived in the Dasha periods of the Rashi,  \nor Grah concerned. Notes. \u2018Argala\u2019 in Sanskrit is figuratively used to denote an impediment, or obstruction. Some suggest, that the Argala obstruction places are  \ncountable from the Argala place instead of from the original place, or Grah. This is not logical and a glance into Gochar Vedha (obstructions during transits) will  \nconfirm our findings. 10. Special. The Argala, caused by placement of a Grah in the first one fourth part of the Rashi, is countered by another, placed in the 4th  \nquarter of the respective obstructive Rashi. Similarly 2nd quarter\u2019s Argala is eliminated by the 3rd quarter placement of another Grah.

If the Argala causing  \nGrah and the obstructing Grah are in the respective quarters, the obstruction will come to pass. Otherwise not. 11-17. Argala Effects. Should there be Argala for the  \nArudh Pad, for the natal Lagn and for the 7th from both, the native will be famous and fortunate. A malefic, or a benefic, causing unobstructed Argala, giving a  \nDrishti to Lagn will make one famous. Similarly a malefic, or a benefic, causing unobstructed Argala, giving a Drishti to Dhan Bhava denotes acquisition of wealth  \nand grains, to Sahaj Bhava happiness from co-born, to Bandhu Bhava residences, quadrupeds and relatives, to Putr Bhava sons, grand sons and intelligence, to  \nAri Bhava fear from enemies, to Yuvati Bhava abundant wealth and marital happiness, to Randhr Bhava difficulties, to Dharm Bhava fortunes, to Karm Bhava royal  \nhonour, to Labh Bhava gains and to Vyaya Bhava expenses. The Argala by benefics will give various kinds of happiness, while benefic effects will be meddling with  \nmalefic Argalas. Argala by both benefics and malefics will yield results. Notes. 1. Argala can be caused by a benefic, which is known, as Subh Argala. This Argala  \ncan be from a malefic also, so that the benefic, causing Argala, stalls the malefic role. If the benefic\u2019s Argala is obstructed by another, then the benefic will become  \nineffective in Argala and the first-mentioned malefic will operate freely. 2. Argala can be by a malefic with reference to a benefic, so that the native does not enjoy  \ngood effects, due to the benefic. This is Pap (malefic) Argala. If the Argala is eliminated by a benefic, or a malefic, then the first mentioned benefic will be at liberty  \nto act, according to his own disposition. 18. Should there be (unobstructed) Argala for Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava, the native will doubtlessly become a king and  \nfortunate. \n \nCh. 32. Karakatwas of the Grahas \n \n1-2. I now detail below Atma Karak etc., obtainable from among the 7 Grahas, viz. Surya to Sani. Some say, that Rahu will become a Karak, when there is a state  \nof similarity in terms of longitude between (two) Grahas. Yet some say, that the 8 Grahas, including Rahu, will have to be considered irrespective of such a state. 3-\n8. Atma Karak Defined. Among the Grahas from Surya etc. whichever has traversed maximum number of degrees in a particular Rashi is called Atma Karak. If the  \ndegrees are identical, then the one with more minutes of arc and, if the minutes are also identical, then the one with higher seconds of arc, have to be considered.  \nIn that case these three are called Anthya Karak, Madhya Karak and Upakheta. In the case of Rahu deduct his longitude in that particular Rashi from 30. The  \nKarakas will have to be decided, as above and, as per further rules given below. Out of these Karakas, Atma Karak is the most important and has a prime say on  \nthe native, just as the king is the most famous among the men of his country and is the head of all affairs and is entitled to arrest and release men. 9-12.  \nImportance of Atma Karak. O Brahmin, as the minister cannot go against the king, the other Karakas, viz. Putr Karak, Amatya Karak etc. cannot predominate over  \nAtma Karak in the affairs of the native. If the Atma Karak is adverse, other Karakas cannot give their benefic effects. Similarly, if Atma Karak is favourable, other  \nKarakas cannot predominate with their malefic influences. 13-17. Other Karakas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f1120ee-f2b6-4dac-9433-07e021ce33f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f1120ee-f2b6-4dac-9433-07e021ce33f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2dc7802-ae5b-4b12-8ff5-212848545a74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "267547f183949b5ba921d4d68068c3da5b4d7a8d243acedd9b11d3894a0cb7a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cd2f3b6-487a-4cd2-8e63-348adf44fa83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b34bd91fb8993a0735404518daa590bbe943690c30d75ae20825d91569f078dc"}}, "hash": "6989960b536a83189436c92dfa23fa8df835db583a90fa5efbfceadfd5990caf", "text": "13-17. Other Karakas. The Grah next to Atma Karak in terms of longitude is called Amatya Karak.  \nSimilarly following one another in terms of longitude are Bhratru Karak, Matru Karak, Pitru Karak, Putr Karak, Gnati Karak and Stri Karak. These are Char Karakas,  \nor inconstant significators. Some consider Matru Karak and Putr Karak, as identical. If two Grahas have the same longitude, both become the same Karak, in which  \ncase there will be a deficit of one Karak. In that circumstance consider constant significator in the context of benefic/malefic influence for the concerned relative. 18-\n21. Constant Karakatwas. I narrate below the constant Karakatwas, as related to the Grahas. The stronger among Surya and Sukr indicates the father, while the  \nstronger among Candr and Mangal indicates the mother. Mangal denotes sister, brother-in-law, younger brother and mother. Budh rules maternal relative, while  \nGuru indicates paternal grand father. Husband and sons are, respectively, denoted by Sukr and Sani. From Ketu note wife, father, mother, parents-in law and  \nmaternal grand father. These are constant Karakatwas. 22-24. Bhavas Related. These constant significances are derivable from the Bhavas, counted from the said  \nconstant Karakatwas. The 9th from Surya denotes father, the 4th from Candr mother, the 3rd from Mangal brothers, the 6th from Budh maternal uncle, the 5th from  \nGuru sons, the 7th from Sukr wife and the 8th from Sani death. The learned should consider all these and declare related effects accordingly. 25-30. Yog Karakas.  \nO Brahmin, I make below a passing reference to Yog Karakas (mutual co-workers). Grahas become Yog Karakas, if they are in mutual angles identical with own  \nRashis, exaltation Rashis, or friendly Rashis. In Karm Bhava a Grah will be significantly so. Grahas simply (not being in friendly, own, or exaltation Rashis) in Lagn,  \nBandhu and Yuvati Bhava do not become such Yog Karakas. Even, if they be placed in other Bhavas, but with such dignities, as mentioned, shall become Yog  \nKarakas. With such Grahas even a person of mean birth will become a king and be affluent. One born of royal scion, then will surely become a king. Thus the  \neffects be declared, considering the number of such Grahas and the order the native belongs to. 31-34. Bhava Significance. I now narrate the significance of the  \nBhavas. Tanu Bhava denotes the soul (self), Dhan family, finance, wife etc., Sahaj younger brothers/sisters, Putr progeny and Yuvati wife. It is also said, that a  \nGrah in Putr becomes a Karak for wife. The Karakatwas of the Bhava in order are Surya, Guru, Mangal, Candr, Guru, Mangal, Sukr, Sani, Guru, Budh, Guru and  \nSani. 35-37. O excellent of the Brahmins, after knowing the merits of Tanu Bhava etc. the good and bad effects can be declared. Ari, Randhr and Vyaya are Trikas,  \nDusthan, or malefic Bhavas. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh are Upachayas. Dhan, Putr, Randhr and Labh are Panapharas and Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya are  \nApoklimas. Association with Trikas will inflict evils. Kendras and Konas (Putr and Dharm) are auspicious Bhavas, the association with which turns even evil into  \nauspiciousness. (Also see Ch. 34 for more information) \n \nCh. 33.

O Brahmin, as laid down by Lord Brahma, I now tell you about the effects of Karakans identical with Mesh etc. (Karakans is the Navans, occupied by the Atma  \nKarak Grah) 2-8. Karakans in Various Rashis. If Atma Karak happens to be in Mesh Navans, there will be nuisance from rats and cats at all times. A malefic joining  \nwill further increase the nuisance. Should Atma Karak be in Vrishabh Navans, happiness from quadrupeds will result. Should Atma Karak be in Mithun Navans, the  \nnative will be afflicted by itch etc. Should Atma Karak be in Kark Navans, there will be fear from water etc. If Atma Karak happens to be in Simh Navans, fear will be  \nfrom tiger etc. If Atma Karak happens to be in Kanya Navans, itch, corpulence, fire etc. will cause trouble, while, if Atma Karak is in Tula Navans, he will make one  \na trader and skilful in making robes etc. Vrischik Navans, holding Atma Karak, will bring troubles from snakes etc. and also affliction to mother\u2019s breasts. There will  \nbe falls from height and conveyances etc., if it is Dhanu Navans, that is occupied by Atma Karak. Makar Navans in this respect denotes gains from water dwelling  \nbeings and conch, pearl, coral etc. If it is Kumbh Navans, holding Atma Karak, the native will construct tanks etc. And in Meen Navans the Atma Karak will grant  \nfinal emancipation. The Drishti of a benefic will remove evils, while that of a malefic will cause no good. 9-11. O Brahmin, if there be only benefics in Karakans and  \nthe Navans of Lagn receives a Drishti from a benefic, the native will undoubtedly become a king. Should the Kendras/Konas from the Karakans be occupied by  \nbenefics, devoid of malefic association, the native will be endowed with wealth and learning. The combination of benefic and malefic influence will in this context  \nyield mixed results. If the Upakheta (UpaGrah, vide Ch.32 Sloka 5) is in its exaltation, or own, or friendly Rashi and is devoid of a Drishti from a malefic, the native  \nwill go to heaven after death. 12. If the Atma Karak is in the divisions of Candr, Mangal, or Sukr, the native will go to others wives. Otherwise the contrary will  \nprevail. 13-18. Effects of Grahas in the Karakans. O Brahmin, if Surya is in the Karakans, the native will be engaged in royal assignments. If the full Candr is there,  \nhe will enjoy pleasures and be a scholar, more so, if Sukr gives a Drishti to the Karakans. If strong Mangal is in Karakans, he will use the weapon spear, will live  \nthrough fire and be an alchemist. Should strong Budh be Karakans, he will be skilful in arts and trading, be intelligent and educated. Guru in Karakans denotes one,  \ndoing good acts, endowed with spiritualism and Vedic learning. One will be endowed with a longevity of 100 years, be sensuous and will look after state affairs, if  \nSukr is in Karakans. Sani in Karakans will give such livelihood, as due to the natives family. Rahu in Karakans denotes a thief, a bowman, a machinery maker and a  \ndoctor, treating poisonous afflictions. If Ketu be in Karakans, one will deal in elephants and be a thief. 19-22. Rahu-Surya in Karakans. Should Rahu and Surya be  \nin Karakans, there will be fear from snakes. If a benefic gives a Drishti to Rahu-Surya in Karakans, there will be no fear, but a malefic Drishti will bring death  \n(through serpents).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99cea975-f6db-4ef5-8d54-b75975793bdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "99cea975-f6db-4ef5-8d54-b75975793bdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e69a8c41-f416-436a-98b9-37db13a79e92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c67cb249b4678722f7fdba2d1c0214013833243d74c8cf2ca3274d097c61ca00"}, "2": {"node_id": "4cdb9ad0-8eaa-4cd1-a1ac-b7cb07105def", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "693d04d3999ce00606f7d94116dcae7729c5b332c0f45f9a3dcaf6660d8128f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddcd3a62-896e-41a6-b369-62a865e213a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "4ceb53281c371f485af82d9a26977a3fb6750e03cee8fa8df8f14f085ae7a3d8"}}, "hash": "2c4f29c879daf3b9e567cdb8fdf74b08c1e3a3a58c20da76d77ac4a37d2acba7", "text": "If Rahu and Surya occupy benefic Shad Vargas, being in Karakans, one will be a doctor, treating poisonous afflictions, while the Drishti from  \nMangal on Rahu-Surya in Karakans denotes, that the native will burn either his own house, or that of others. Budh\u2019s Drishti on Rahu-Surya in Karakans will not  \ncause the burning of one\u2019s own house, but that of others.

Gulik in Karakans. Should the full Candr give a Drishti  \nto Gulik, placed in the Karakans, the native will lose his wealth to thieves, or will himself be a thief. If Gulik is in Karakans, but does not receive a Drishti from others,  \none will administer poison to others, or will himself die of poisoning. Budh\u2019s Drishti in this context will give large testicles. 25-29. Effects of Drishtis on Ketu in  \nKarakans. If Ketu is in Karakans, receiving a Drishti from a malefic, ones ears will be severed, or one will suffer from diseases of the ears. Sukr, giving a Drishti to  \nKetu in Karakans, denotes one, initiated into religious order. One will be devoid of strength, if Budh and Sani give a Drishti to Ketu in Karakans. If Budh and Sukr  \ngive a Drishti to Ketu in Karakans, one will be the son of a female slave, or of a female remarried. With Sani\u2019s Drishti on Ketu in Karakans one will perform penance,  \nor be a servant, or will be a pseudo-ascetic. Sukr and Surya together, giving a Drishti to Ketu in Karakans, will make one serve the king. Thus, o Brahmin, are told  \nbriefly the effects of Karakans. 30-31. Effects of the 2nd from Karakans.

Rahu in the 2nd from Karakans will destroy wealth. 32.  \nEffects of the 3rd from Karakans. A malefic in the 3rd from Karakans will make one valorous, while a benefic in the 3rd from Karakans will make one timid. 33-35.  \nEffects of the 4th from Karakans. If the 4th from Karakans happens to be occupied by Sukr and Candr, one will own large buildings, like palaces etc. Similar is the  \neffect of an exalted Grah in the said 4th. A house, made of stones, is denoted by the occupation of the 4th from Karakans by Rahu and Sani. Mangal and Ketu in  \nthe 4th from Karakans indicate a house, made of bricks, while Guru in the 4th from Karakans denotes a house, made of wood. Surya in the 4th from Karakans will  \ngive a house of grass. If Candr is in the 4th from Karakans, one will have union with his wife in an uncompounded house. 36-40.

Should Budh be in the 5th from Karakans, the native will be an  \nascetic of the highest order, or one, holding staff. Surya in the 5th from Karakans denotes one, using a knife. Mangal in the 5th from Karakans denotes one, using a  \nspear. Sani denotes a bowman, if Sani is placed in the 5th from Karakans. Rahu in the 5th from Karakans denotes a machinist. Ketu in the 5th from Karakans  \ndenotes a watch maker. Sukr in the 5th from Karakans will make one a poet and an eloquent speaker. 41-45. Effects of Karakans and the 5th from there.

Sukr will make one an ordinary writer, while Budh will indicate, that the writing skills are  \nless than those of an ordinary writer.

Mangal denotes a logician, Budh a Mimamsaka (follower of Karma Mimansa), Sani indicates, that one is dull-witted in the assembly,  \nSurya denotes, that one is a musician, Candr denotes a follower of Sankhya philosophy (of Maharishi Kapila, who enumerated 25 true principles with emphasis on  \nfinal bliss) and indicates, that one is versed in rhetorics and singing and Ketu, or Rahu denotes, that one is a Jyotishi. Should Guru be related to the positions of  \nKarakans, or the 5th from there, while the Karakans is caused by others than him, the effects, as stated, will effectively come to pass. Some say, that the 2nd from  \nKarakans should also be similarly considered. 46. Effects of the 6th from Karakans.

The 3rd from Karakans should also be similarly considered. 47-48. Effects of the 7th  \nfrom Karakans. If Candr and Guru are in the 7th from Karakans, the native will beget a very beautiful wife. Sukr in the 7th form Karakans denotes a sensuous wife,  \nwhile Budh in the 7th from Karakans indicates a wife, versed in arts.

If a  \nmalefic simultaneously gives a Drishti to two malefics in a Kon from Karakans, the native will use his learnings of Mantras and Tantras for malevolent purposes,  \nwhile a benefic\u2019s Drishti will make him use the learnings for public good. 77-84\u00bd. If Candr is in the Karakans, receiving a Drishti from Sukr, the native will be an  \nalchemist and, if receiving a Drishti from Budh the native will be a doctor capable of curing all diseases. If Candr is in the 4th from Karakans and receives a Drishti  \nfrom Sukr, the native will be afflicted by white leprosy. If receiving a Drishti from Mangal, the native will have blood and bilious disorders and, if receiving a Drishti  \nfrom Ketu, the native will suffer from black leprosy. Should Rahu and Mangal be in the 4th, or 5th from Karakans, the native will suffer from pulmonary consumption  \nand, if simultaneously there happens to be Candr\u2019s Drishti on the 4th, or the 5th, this affliction will be certain. Mangal alone in the 4th, or the 5th will cause ulcers. If  \nKetu is in the 4th, or the 5th, one will suffer from dysentery and afflictions, due to (impure) water. Rahu and Gulik will make one a doctor, curing poisonous  \nafflictions, or will cause troubles through poison. Should Sani be alone in the 4th, or 5th, the native will be skillful in archery.

O Brahmin, thus I have told you about the effects, derivable through Karakans. Now listen to the effects, arising out of lordships of Grahas over Bhavas. 2-7.  \nNature due to Lordships of Grahas. Benefics, owning Kendras, will not give benefic effects, while malefics, owning Kendras, will not remain inauspicious. The Lord  \nof a Kon will give auspicious results. The Lord of Lagn is specially auspicious, as Lagn is a Kendr, as well as a Kon. Putr and Dharm Bhava are specially for wealth,  \nwhile Yuvati and Karm Bhava are specially for happiness. Any Grah, owning Sahaj, Ari, or Labh Bhava, will give evil effects. The effects, due to the Lords of Vyaya  \nand Randhr Bhava, will depend on their association. In each group the significance will be in the ascending order. Randhr\u2019s Lord is not auspicious, as he owns the  \n12th from Dharm Bhava. If the Lord of Randhr Bhava simultaneously owns Sahaj, Yuvati, or Labh Bhava, he will prove specifically harmful, while his simultaneous  \nownership of a Kon will bestow auspicious effects. The Grah, owning a predominant Bhava, will stall the effects, due to another, owning a less significant Bhava  \nand will give his own results. Randhr\u2019s lordship of Surya and Candr is not evil. 8-10. Natural Benefics and Malefics. Guru and Sukr are benefics, while Candr is  \nmediocre in benefice and Budh is neutral (a benefic, when associated with a benefic and a malefic, when related to a malefic). Malefics are Surya, Sani and  \nMangal. Full Candr, Budh, Guru and Sukr are stronger in the ascending order. Weak Candr, Surya, Sani and Mangal are stronger (in malefic disposition) in the  \nascending order. In revealing maleficence, due to rulership of Kendras, Candr, Budh, Guru and Sukr are significant in the ascending order. 11-12.

Lordships of  \nKendras and Konas. If there be an exchange between a Lord of a Kendr and a Lord of a Kon, or, if a Lord of a Kendr is yuti with a Lord of a Kon in a Kendr, or in a  \nKon, or, if a Lord of a Kon is in a Kendr, or vice versa, or, if there happens to be a full Drishti between a Lord of a Kendr and a Lord of a Kon, they cause a Yog.  \nOne born in such a Yog will become a king and be famous. 13. If one and the same Grah gets the lordships of a Kon, as well as a Kendr, or, if a Grah is in a Kendr,  \nor in a Kon, it will prove specially a Yog Karak. 14. Lordship of Kendr. It has been said, that a malefic, owning a Kendr, will become auspicious, which is true, only  \nwhen it simultaneously Lords over a Kon and not by merely owning a Kendr. 15. If the Lords of a Kendr, or a Kon own simultaneously an evil Bhava, he does not  \ncause a Raj Yog by mere relations stipulated (as per Ch. 34, Slokas 11 and 12). 16. Rahu and Ketu. Rahu and Ketu give predominantly the effects, as due to their  \nyuti with a Bhava Lord, or, as due to the Bhava they occupy. 17. If Rahu and/or Ketu are in Kendr, receiving a Drishti from, or in association with the Lord of a Kon,  \nor of a Kendr, it will become Yog Karak. 18. O Maharishi Parashar, please narrate, according to the Rashis rising, as to which Grah is a Yog Karak and which is  \ninauspicious. 19-22. Grahas and Mesh Lagn. O Brahmin, listen to these with examples. Even though Mangal is the Lord of Randhr Bhava, he will be helpful to  \nauspicious Grahas. Sani, Budh and Sukr are malefics. Auspicious are Guru and Surya. The mere Yuti of Sani with Guru will not produce auspicious effects  \n(although they own a Kon and a Kendr). If Guru is at the disposal of a malefic, he will surely give inauspicious results. Sukr is a direct (independent) killer. Sani etc.  \nwill also inflict death, if associated with an adverse Grah (Sukr). 23-24. Grahas and Vrishabh Lagn. Guru, Sukr and Candr are malefics. Sani and Surya are  \nauspicious. Sani will cause Raj Yog. Budh is somewhat inauspicious. The Guru group (Guru, Candr and Sukr) and Mangal will inflict death. 25-26. Grahas and  \nMithun Lagn. Mangal, Guru and Surya are malefics, while Sukr is the only auspicious Grah. The Yuti of Guru with Sani is similar to that for Mesh Lagn. Candr is the  \nprime killer, but it is dependant on her association. 27-28. Grahas and Kark Lagn. Sukr and Budh are malefics, Mangal, Guru and Candr are auspicious. Mangal is  \ncapable of conferring a full-fledged Yog and giving auspicious effects. Sani and Surya are killers and give effects, according to their associations. 29-30. Grahas  \nand Simh Lagn. Budh, Sukr and Sani are malefics. Auspicious effects will be given by Mangal, Guru and Surya. Guru\u2019s Yuti with Sukr (though, respectively, Kon  \nand Kendr Lords) will not produce auspicious results.

If all the Grahas are in the 4 Kendras, Kamal Yog is produced. If all of them happen to be in all the Apoklimas, or in all the Panapharas,  \nVapi Yog occurs. 13. Yup, Shar, Shakti and Danda Yogas. If all the 7 Grahas are in the 4 Bhavas, commencing from Lagn, they cause Yup Yog, if from Bandhu,  \nShar Yog occurs, if from Yuvati, Shakti Yog occurs and, if from Karm, Danda Yog is formed. 14.

If all the Grahas occupy the  \nseven Bhavas from Lagn, Nauka Yog occurs, if from Bandhu, Koot Yog is formed, if from Yuvati, Chatr Yog occurs and, if from Karm, Chap Yog occurs. Here again  \nthe Grahas should occupy seven continuous Bhavas. Quoted from Saravali. If the seven Grahas occupy continuously seven Bhavas, commencing from a Bhava,  \nwhich is not angular to the Lagna, the Yoga produced is known, as Ardh Candra Yoga. 15. Chakr and Samudr Yogas. If all the Grahas occupy six alternative  \nRashis, commencing from Lagn, Chakr Yog is formed. Samudr Yog is produced, if all Grahas occupy six alternative Rashis, commencing from Dhan Bhava. 16-17.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c839ce3-b941-47e8-ae5a-704eab75fb28": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c839ce3-b941-47e8-ae5a-704eab75fb28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1079ef52-063b-418f-b8b1-95161bbc9d0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "0bd0794087b054f7f912a75c24d4b996003e9b1552558daece2c3008be8fd6da"}, "2": {"node_id": "530f0117-f0c3-4133-abb1-4fca59124976", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "933d8267d70e26cf7c81cf0888d4514f7f8f6b136600daf321a0cea72abe6a35"}, "3": {"node_id": "dee8f664-f64c-47a3-ba81-2e1c0344db55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "e727683844eae1163d375520f64ae65970cd031f839ebaeb0ad2bcaef573795b"}}, "hash": "c1b99b908c5ee36a9612550e5a88a11c2d3730ec922384d862b1edc7f6003ab9", "text": "16-17.  \nSankhya Yogas.

If benefics occupy the 8th,  \n6th and 7th, counted from Candr, Adhi Yog obtains. According to the strength of the participating Grahas, the native concerned will be either a king, or a minister, or  \nan Army chief. 6. Dhan Yog. Should all the (three) benefics be Upachaya, counted from Candr, one will be very affluent. With two benefics, placed in the 3rd, the  \n6th, the 10th and the 11th, one will have medium effects in regard to wealth. If a single benefic is there, the wealth will be negligible. 7-10. Sunaph, Anaph and  \nDuradhar. If there is a Grah other than Surya, in the 2nd from Candr, Sunaph Yog is formed, if in the 12th from Candr, Anaph Yog is formed and, if in the 2nd and  \n12th from Candr, Duradhar Yog is caused.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c12f11c9-de07-4fe2-8b3a-ea29a13f5ce8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c12f11c9-de07-4fe2-8b3a-ea29a13f5ce8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf37421-b3f3-4c71-a1d1-5be67cc9cdae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "1cdce6b4f17759b5fcc2ff15bda4dc05ed892c4bb3db8d9e983fd093616829e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9c55796-85db-42ee-a69f-74ca88ab9177", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "27b1e0a3faca176d9de7be691b2dd986a65fa562014fab3f98c84186df758473"}, "3": {"node_id": "932497d4-4363-43b3-af9e-fc0305340c0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "5a200e2169a2a9031442db727a05b6cafea963f7a2109751fd6cb2df43673ee4"}}, "hash": "c2f3203c0dc129418abb0768cea409acf297e69deced7ac3f750e84126092d17", "text": "One with Sunaph Yog will be a king, or equal to a king, endowed with intelligence, wealth, fame and self-earned wealth.  \nOne born in Anaph Yog will be a king, be free from diseases, virtuous, famous, charming and happy.

Excluding Surya, should there be no Grah with Candr, or in  \nthe 2nd and/or 12th from Candr, or in a Kendr from Lagn, Kema Drum Yog is formed. One born in Kema Drum Yog will be very much reproached, will be bereft of  \nintelligence, learning, reduced to penury and perils. \n \nCh. 38. Surya\u2019s Yogas \n \n1.

One born with Vosi Yog will be skilful, charitable and endowed with  \nfame, learning and strength. The Ubhayachari native will be a king, or equal to a king and be happy. 4. Benefics, causing Vesi, Vosi, or Ubhayachari Yogas, will  \ngive the above-mentioned effects, while malefics will produce contrary effects \n \nCh. 39. Raj Yog \n \n1-2. O excellent of the Brahmins, I now narrate below the Raj Yogas, making one entitled to royal honour. These were told to Parvati by Lord Shiva once upon a  \ntime, the gist of which is, as follows. 3-5. Raj Yogas are to be known from the Karakans Lagn and the natal Lagn. On the one hand the pair of Atma Karak and Putr  \nKarak should be considered and on the other hand the natal Lagn\u2019s Lord and Putr\u2019s Lord should be taken into consideration. The effects, due to such association,  \nwill be full, or a half, or a quarter, according to their strengths. 6-7. Maha Raj Yog. Should Lagn\u2019s Lord and Putr\u2019s Lord exchange their Rashis, or, if Atma Karak and  \nPutr Karak (Char) are in Lagn, or in Putr Bhava, or in the exaltation Rashi, or in own Rashi, or in own Navans, receiving a Drishti from a benefic, Maha Raj Yog is  \nproduced. The native so born will be famous and happy. 8. If Lagn\u2019s Lord and Atma Karak are in Tanu, Putr, or Yuvati Bhava, yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from a  \nbenefic, a Raj Yog is formed. 9-10. Should there be benefics in the 2nd, the 4th and the 5th, counted either from Lagn\u2019s Lord, or from Atma Karak Rashi, one will  \nbecome a king. Similarly malefics in the 3rd and 6th from Lagn\u2019s Lord, or from Atma Karak Rashi will make one a king. 11. One will be related to royal circles, if  \nSukr is the Karakans, or in the 5th there from, or in Lagn, or in Arudh Lagn, receiving a Drishti from, or yuti with Guru, or Candr. 12. Even, if a single Grah gives a  \nDrishti to the natal Lagn, or Hora Lagn, or Ghatik Lagn, the native will become a king. 13-14.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "932497d4-4363-43b3-af9e-fc0305340c0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "932497d4-4363-43b3-af9e-fc0305340c0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daf37421-b3f3-4c71-a1d1-5be67cc9cdae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "1cdce6b4f17759b5fcc2ff15bda4dc05ed892c4bb3db8d9e983fd093616829e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c12f11c9-de07-4fe2-8b3a-ea29a13f5ce8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c2f3203c0dc129418abb0768cea409acf297e69deced7ac3f750e84126092d17"}}, "hash": "5a200e2169a2a9031442db727a05b6cafea963f7a2109751fd6cb2df43673ee4", "text": "13-14.

If  \nthe 3 Lagnas (natal, Hora and Ghatik) are occupied by Grahas in exaltation, or in own Rashi, or, if the natal Lagn, the Dreshkan Lagn and the Navans Lagn have  \nexalted Grahas, Raj Yog is formed. 16.

Again a Raj Yog is formed, if Ari\u2019s, Randhr\u2019s and Vyaya\u2019s Lords are in fall, or in inimical Rashis, or in combustion, as Lagn\u2019s Lord, placed in his own Rashi,  \nor in its exaltation Rashi, gives a Drishti to Lagn. 21. If Karm\u2019s Lord, placed in his own Bhava, or in its exaltation Rashi, gives a Drishti to Lagn, a Raj Yog is formed.  \nSimilar is the case, if benefics are in Kendras. 22. If the Atma Karak Grah is in a benefic\u2019s Rashi/Navans, the native will be wealthy. If there are benefics in Kendras  \nfrom Karakans Lagn, he will become a king. 23. If the Arudh Lagn and Dar Pad are in mutual Kendras, or in mutual Sahaj/Labh Bhavas, or in mutual Konas, the  \nnative will doubtlessly become a king. 24. If two, or all of Bhava, Hora, Ghatik Lagnas are receiving a Drishti from exalted Grahas, a Raj Yog is formed. 25. If  \nBhava, Hora and Ghatik Lagnas, their Dreshkanas and Navansas, or the said Lagnas and their Navansas, or the said Lagnas and their Dreshkanas receive a  \nDrishti from a Grah, a Raj Yog is formed. 26-27. If Arudh Pad is occupied by an exalted Grah, particularly Candr in exaltation, or by Guru and/or Sukr (with, or  \nwithout exaltation), while there is no Argala by a malefic, the native will become a king. If the Arudh Pad is a benefic Rashi, containing Candr, while Guru is in Dhan  \nBhava, the same effect will prevail. 28. Even, if one among Ari\u2019s, Randhr\u2019s and Vyaya\u2019s Lords, being in debilitation, gives a Drishti to Lagn, there will be a Raj Yog.  \n29-31. The native will become a king, if a Grah, ruling Bandhu, Karm, Dhan, or Labh, gives a Drishti to Lagn, while Sukr gives a Drishti to the 11th from Arudh Lagn,  \nas Arudh Lagn is occupied by a benefic. The same effect will be obtained, if a debilitated Grah gives a Drishti to Lagn and is placed in Ari, or Randhr Bhava. Again  \nsimilar result will prevail, if a debilitated Grah, placed in Sahaj, or Labh Bhava, gives a Drishti to Lagn. 32. I now tell you of the Raj Yogas, based on the Grahas with  \ndifferent dignities and on the Drishtis and Yutis of the Grahas. 33-34. Dharm\u2019s Lord is akin to a minister and more especially Putr\u2019s Lord. If these two Grahas  \nmutually give a Drishti, the native will obtain a kingdom. Even, if these two are yuti in any Bhava, or, if they happen to be placed in mutually 7th places, one born of  \nroyal scion will become a king. 35. The native will attain a kingdom, if Bandhu\u2019s Lord is in Karm Bhava and Karm\u2019s Lord is in Bandhu Bhava and, if these Grahas  \ngive a Drishti to Putr\u2019s and Dharm\u2019s Lords. 36. If the Lords of Putr, Karm, Bandhu and Lagn are yuti in Dharm Bhava, one will become a ruler with fame, spreading  \nover the four directions. 37. Should the Lord of Bandhu, or of Karm Bhava join either the Putr\u2019s Lord, or Dharm\u2019s Lord, the native will obtain a kingdom. 38. If Putr\u2019s  \nLord is in Lagn, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava, yuti with Dharm\u2019s Lord, or Lagn Lord, the native will become a king. 39.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a4f150f-78b6-4c69-80db-4904d458155c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a4f150f-78b6-4c69-80db-4904d458155c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4278c200-cabb-4682-9055-20bc0f59e916", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "5e719160dd112798038da463b8ba7b89b6b7127a96564fc3e192833358cd86a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ebfa1dd-e457-4cba-84e1-4bdccce5773e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "4c0ff1ceb577798af662ebb132a04870e880f16984443fbe308b5672158a4179"}, "3": {"node_id": "abe61e27-bbee-463f-8895-b9522b72b896", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "5dc9a98d54656425dcd2f0bff9c31cc75a14ff41293bd439ebf453cf10aa141a"}}, "hash": "107efc02d0aabce692065e41e4dd5166188e335d58a2dc62a51457342180f24b", "text": "39.

Should Candr, endowed with strength, be Vargottans and receives a  \nDrishti from four, or more Grahas, the native will become a king. 43.

Yogas For Royal Association \n \n1. If Karm\u2019s Lord is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from the dispositor of Amatya Karak, or even, if Karm\u2019s Lord is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from Amatya Karak  \nhimself, the native will be a chief in the king\u2019s court. 2. If Karm and Labh Bhava are devoid of malefic occupation and devoid of Drishti from a malefic, while Labh  \nBhava receives a Drishti from its own Lord, the native will be a chief in the king\u2019s court. 3. Should Amatya Karak and the dispositor of Atma Karak be together, the  \nnative will be endowed with great intelligence and will be a king\u2019s minister. (\u2018Karakendr\u2019 is interpreted here, as the dispositor of Atma Karak. Similarly \u2018Amatyesa\u2019  \nmeans the dispositor of Amatya Karak) 4. If Atma Karak is strong and is with a benefic, or Amatya Karak is in its own Bhava, or in exaltation, one will surely become  \na king\u2019s minister. 5. There is no doubt in one\u2019s becoming a king\u2019s minister and famous, if Atma Karak is in Tanu, or Putr, or Dharm Bhava. 6. If Atma Karak, or  \nAmatya Karak is placed in a Kendr, or in a Kon, the native will beget royal mercy, royal patronage and happiness thereof. 7. Should malefics be in the 3rd and the  \n6th from Atma Karak, or from Arudh Lagn, or in Sahaj and Ari Bhava, one will become Army chief. 8. If Atma Karak is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, or in exaltation, or in  \nits own Bhava and gives a Drishti to Dharm\u2019s Lord, the native will be a king\u2019s minister. 9.

Should a Rashi of Budh be Putr  \nBhava and be occupied by Budh himself, as Labh Bhava is occupied by Candr, Mangal and Guru, the native will be very affluent. 4.

Should Surya and Candr be in Labh Bhava, as  \nSani is in Putr Bhava identical with his own Bhava, the native will be very affluent. 6. Should Guru be in Putr Bhava identical with his own Rashi, as Budh is in Labh  \nBhava, the native will be very affluent. 7. If a Rashi of Mangal happens to be Putr Bhava with Mangal therein, while Sukr is in Labh Bhava, the native will become  \nvery affluent. 8. If Kark happens to be Putr Bhava, containing Candr therein, while Sani is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent. 9. Yogas for Wealth  \n(up to Sloka 15). Should Surya be in Simh identical with Lagn and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from Mangal and Guru, one will be wealthy. 10. Should Candr  \nbe in Kark identical with Lagn and be yuti with, or receiving a Drishti from Budh and Guru, one will be wealthy. 11.

Lords of Kendras and Konas Related. The Kendras are known, as Vishnu Sthanas (Bhavas of Lord Vishnu), while  \nthe Konas are called Lakshmi Sthanas. If the Lord of a Kendr establishes a relationship with the Lord of a Kon, a Raj Yog is obtained. (A sixth kind of relationship  \ncan also be extended in this context to Navans positions, though there is no specific classic sanction for this. For example in the case of a Makar native Mangal in  \nthe Navans of Sukr and Sukr in the Navans of Mangal will confer a superior Raj Yog. This form of relationship will be equally superior, like the first 3 relationships,  \nmentioned in the earlier paragraph). 29-34 Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Related Lords of Kendras and Lords of Konas. If the Lord of a Kendr and the Lord of  \na Kon, having a relationship, as indicated in Sloka 28, happen to be in Parijatans, the native will be king and will protect men, if in Uttamans, will be an excellent  \nking, endowed with elephants, horses, chariots etc., if in Gopurans, will be a tiger of kings, honoured by other kings and, if in Simhasanans, will be an emperor,  \nruling over the entire earth. With the said Raj Yog relationship of the said Grahas in Simhasanans were born Harish Candr, Manu, Bali, Agni Deva and many  \nemperors. In the present Yuga so born is Yudhishtira (Dharm Raj of Mahabharat). Salivahana\u2019s birth and that of others will also come with this Yog. With such  \nLords, placed in Paravatans, Manu etc. were born. The Incarnations of Lord Vishnu took place, when such Lords were placed in Devalokans. With such Lords,  \nplaced in Brahmalokans, Lord Brahma was born and, placed in Iravatans, the Swayambhu Manu was born. (Manu is the first of the 14 Manus, identified, as the  \nsecond creator, who produced the Prajapatis. To Manu the code of laws, Manu Smriti is ascribed). \n \nCh. 42. Combinations for Penury \n \n1.

A Grah,  \nassociated with one of the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava, being bereft of a Drishti from the Lord of a Kon, will in its Dasha periods cause harm to the  \nnative\u2019s financial aspects. 14. If the 8th/12th from Atma Karak, or Randhr/Vyaya Bhava receive a Drishti from the Atma Karak\u2019s Navans Lord and the Lord of Janma  \nLagn, the native will be bereft of wealth. 15. The native will be a spendthrift, if the 12th from Atma Karak receives a Drishti from the dispositor of Atma Karak, or, if  \nVyaya Bhava receives a Drishti from the Lord of Lagn. 16-18. Now I tell you some Yogas for poverty along with conditions of their nullifications. Should Mangal and  \nSani be together in Dhan Bhava, the native\u2019s wealth will be destroyed. Should Budh give a Drishti to Mangal and Sani in Dhan Bhava, there will be great wealth.  \nThere is no doubt in it. Surya in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti from Sani, will cause penury, while, if Surya is in Dhan Bhava and does not receive a Drishti from  \nSani, riches and fame will be obtained. The same effects (poverty) will be declared, if Sani is in Dhan Bhava, receiving a Drishti from Surya. \n \nCh. 43. Longevity \n \n1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have dealt with combinations for wealth and poverty. Kindly detail methods of ascertaining the life-span of human beings. 2-3. O  \nBrahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate methods of ascertaining longevity. Knowing that longevity is difficult even for gods. Many exponents have laid down  \nvarious methods of longevity calculations. Following is the summary of such schools of thought. 4-8. Pindayu. The Grahas contribute to longevity, according to their  \nbeing in exaltation, or debilitation and also based on their strengths and weaknesses and positions in Ashvini etc. and in the various Rashis. First of all Pindayu is  \nbased on the positions of the Grahas. O Brahmin, listen carefully to what I say: 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21 and 20 are the number of years, contributed by the Grahas,  \nfrom Surya etc., when in exaltation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e053196-9092-4c6b-a628-aa8be8341c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e053196-9092-4c6b-a628-aa8be8341c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e190911-89af-4a7c-aa8c-15a753f4c078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "1dbde5bf47a745b24b2bc18df9717a80ae934cdbaeeb952acf90a5f960647236"}, "2": {"node_id": "e53b9f3e-379e-4899-bb4c-b0bf63644833", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "d2107671d873801ad2d0ee3aec9ec81217223fbddc0684e814c1b0e5f5765e6f"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b1e94f8-65de-491e-97c0-19ef2e2f9baf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "3a857c227b74e132fbbe4c06705efca688b5a3e5522335647a2df783e8ad7e51"}}, "hash": "22bd5bc25acae1d860a184be0fa14d548dca17f14fb4682906e275a1e9089f82", "text": "These are half of the above in debilitation. And, if the Grahas are in between exaltation and debilitation, the rule of three  \nprocess should be used. Deduct the actual position of the Grah from its deep exaltation point. If the product is less than 6 Rashis, deduct it again from 12 Rashis.  \nThe product concerned should be multiplied by the number of years allotted to the Grah and divided by 12 to get the Grah\u2019s actual contribution. 9. Rectifications.  \nExcepting Sukr and Sani, the contributions, made by others, should be halved, if they are eclipsed by Surya. One third should be reduced, if the Grah is in its  \ninimical Rashi. This does not apply to the one in retrogression (see Vakra Charam). 10-11. Deductions for Grahas in the Visible Half of the Zodiac. Full, half, one  \nthird, one fourth, one fifth and one sixth are the deductions of contributions, made by malefics, placed in the visible half of the zodiac. Benefics in such cases lose  \nonly half of what malefics lose. Should there be more than one Grah in a Bhava, the deduction, due to the strongest, will only prevail and not deductions, due to  \nother Grahas in that particular Bhava. Waning Candr is a benefic for this purpose. 12-13. Malefics in Lagn. In case Tanu Bhava is occupied by malefics, adopt the  \nfollowing procedure. Convert Lagn\u2019s Sphuta into minutes of arc and multiply it by the years etc., contributed by the occupant, and divide by 21600. The years etc.  \nso arrived be deducted from the respective contribution, which will be the net span, donated by the Grah. If there is benefic\u2019s Drishti on Lagn, containing malefics,  \nthen the loss is only half. 14-15. Lagn\u2019s Contribution. The number of years, contributed by Lagn, will correspond to the number of Rashis it gained (from Mesh),  \nwhile the degrees Lagn has gained in the particular Rashi will also correspondingly donate (30\u00b0 = l year). If the Lagn\u2019s Lord in the Navans is stronger than Lagn\u2019s  \nLord, then the contribution should be computed only based on the number of Navansas gained (from Mesh), otherwise the computation will be for the Rashi Lagn.  \n16-17. Nisargayu. O Brahmin, now I tell you about Nisargayu. 1, 2, 9, 20, 18, 20 and 50 are the years, allotted to Candr, Mangal, Budh, Sukr, Guru, Surya and Sani  \nfrom the period of birth. 18-19. Ansayu. Now I will tell you about Ansayu contributions by Lagn and Grahas. The years correspond to the number of Navansas,  \ncounted from Mesh. Multiply the longitude in question by 108. If the product exceeds 12, expunge multiples of 12 and consider the final product in Rashis, degrees  \netc., as years, months etc. 20-22. The same reductions, as per Pindayu, apply to Ansayu as well; i.e. half for a combust Grah, one third for inimical placement and  \nthe ones, due for placements in the half of the zodiac, counted from the 12th backwards. Some scholars suggest further corrections for Ansayu, viz. to increase  \nthreefold the contribution of a Grah in exaltation, or in own Bhava and double the contribution, if the contributor is in his own Navans, or in his own Dreshkan. If  \ndoubling and trebling is warranted, only trebling be done. In case of reductions also only halving is to be done, if both halving and reducing a third are required.

Now I\u2019ll tell you about the full life-span figures for various living beings. Gods and sages enjoy endless life-span (in  \nastronomical proportions, as against ordinary mortals).

If all the three are equally strong, the  \naverage of the three should be considered. 33-40. Other Clues to Longevity. O excellent of the Brahmins, I will now give you details of other methods in the matter  \nof longevity, as under. This is based on the positions of Lagn\u2019s Lord, Randhr\u2019s Lord, Sani, Candr, natal Lagn and Hora Lagn. These six are grouped into three  \ngroups thus: the Lords of Lagn and of Randhr Bhava on the one hand, Sani and Candr on the other hand and the natal Lagn and Hora Lagn on yet the other hand.  \nOut of a group of two, if the two are in Movable Rashis, long life is denoted. One in a Fixed Rashi and the other in a Dual Rashi will also bestow long life. One in a  \nMovable Rashi and the other in a Fixed Rashi will give medium life. If both are in Dual Rashis, then again medium life will be obtained. Short life is denoted, if one is  \nin a Movable Rashi, as the other is in a Dual Rashi, or, if both are in Fixed Rashis. The type of life, denoted by three, or two groups be only considered. If the three  \ngroups denote different scales, then the one, indicated by the pair of natal Lagn and Hora Lagn should be only considered. In case of three different indications, if  \nCandr is in Lagn, or Yuvati Bhava, then the one, indicated by the Sani-Candr pair will only come to pass. 41-44. Further Clarifications. If long life is denoted by all  \nthe said three groups, the span is 120 years, if by two groups, it is 108 years and, if only by one group it is 91 years. If medium life is arrived at by three groups, it is  \n80 years, if indicated by 2 groups, it is 72 years and, if by one group, it is 64 years. If short life is denoted by the said three groups, it is only 32 years, if indicated by  \ntwo groups, the life-span is 36 years and, if by one group, the life-span is 40 years. These are rectified, as under. 45-46. Rectifications. If the contributor is in the  \nbeginning of a Rashi, his donation will be full and it will be nil, if he is at the end of a Rashi. For intermediary placements rule of three process will apply. Add the  \nlongitudes of the contributors and the sum so arrived at must be divided by the number of contributors. The latest product should be multiplied by the number of  \nbasic years and divided by 30. This will yield the net longevity. 47. Special Rule for Sani. Should Sani be a contributor, the class of longevity declines. Some  \nadvocate contrarily an increase of class in this context. If Sani is in its own Rashi, or in exaltation, change in class will not occur. Even, if he receives a Drishti from,  \nor is yuti with only a malefic, no change occurs. 48. Special Rule for Guru. If Guru is in Lagn, or in Yuvati Bhava and receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with only  \nbenefics, the class of longevity will increase. 49-50. Increase and Fall in Class of Longevity. From very short life to short life, from short life to medium life, from  \nmedium life to long life and from long life to extremely long life are the increases in the classification of longevity, when Guru warrants an increase. The reverse is  \ntrue, if Sani warrants a fall in the span of life. 51. (Maitreya says) You have narrated various kinds of longevity computations. Please favour me by denoting subtle  \nclasses thereof and poor and long life-spans. 52. (Maharishi Parashar replies) These are seven-fold, viz. Bal Risht, Yog Risht, short, medium, long, super-natural  \n(Divya) and immortality (Amritayu).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9024b765-87e2-42ec-8d07-f928c36ef5c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "9024b765-87e2-42ec-8d07-f928c36ef5c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a09cab3-59b4-46a0-a5c5-8d3582b875c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "fb14afa1ea8bb43044e6fcbc3d6e967d0745bb22c9ce96bc72cbbb9d45565f44"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5fa3a02-d7e8-43f1-b64e-1f04101955c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "558459772c59e6d52f6b2f0f02d372aa92b6df7d9eb79075a680ba37f76b7ca2"}, "3": {"node_id": "61f3fdb4-0af2-4090-81f9-3b92e0e76b84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "43e8debb0bac31550a52b625d8544514005b937da04704c8431ea0dcb4103b97"}}, "hash": "7c79bd9414cefe95ee6424c5ec91d0e8642728507c1debe8e4b17e4bb19780fb", "text": "53-54.

Above this super-natural life-span of 1000 years it is Amritayu, which can be acquired only by those, who deserve it.  \n55. Limitless Longevity.

Super-Natural Longevity. One having benefics in Kendras and/or Konas, while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava  \nwill obtain super-natural life-span. Randhr Bhava in this case should be one of the Rashis, owned by a benefic. 57. Living until the End of the Yuga.

O Maharishi Parashar, you have mentioned a lot about longevity. Be kind enough to throw light on Marakas, or killers. 2-5. O Brahmin, Sahaj and Randhr Bhava  \nare the two Bhavas of longevity. The Bhavas, related to death, are the 12th from each of these, i.e. Dhan and Yuvati Bhava are Marak Bhavas. 3. Out of the two,  \nDhan Bhava is a powerful Marak Bhava. The Lords of Dhan and Yuvati Bhava, malefics in Dhan and Yuvati Bhava and malefics, yuti with Dhan\u2019s Lord and yuti with  \nYuvati\u2019s Lord are all known, as Marakas. The major and sub-periods of these Grahas will bring death on the native, depending on whether he is a long life, medium  \nlife, or short life person. 6-7. The Dasha of a benefic Grah, related to Vyaya\u2019s Lord may also inflict death. End may descend on the native in Randhr\u2019s Lord\u2019s Dasha.  \nThe Dasha of a Grah, which is an exclusive malefic, may also cause death. 9. Should Sani be ill-disposed and be related to a Marak Grah, he will be the first to kill  \nin preference to other Grahas. 10-14. O Brahmin, I tell you further about Marakas. Narrated earlier are three kinds of life-spans, viz. short, medium and long. Short  \nlife is before 32 years, later on up to 64 it is medium life and from 64 to 100 it is long life. Beyond 100 the longevity is called supreme. O excellent of the Brahmins, it  \nis impossible to decide upon longevity till the native is 20 years old. Till such year the child should be protected by sacred recitations, religious offerings (of Ghi etc.)  \nto consecrated fire, as prescribed in the Vedas etc. and through medical treatments, for premature death may descend on the child due to sins of father and  \nmother, or of its own (in the previous birth). 15-21. I further mention about the Marak Grahas. One born with short life combinations may face death in the Dasha,  \ndenoted by Vipat star (3rd from the birth star), one of medium life may die in the Dasha, denoted by Pratyak star (5th from the birth star). In the Dasha, denoted by  \nVadh star (7th from the birth star), one with long life may obtain his end. The Dasha of the Lord of the 22nd Dreshkan, or 23rd, or 3rd, or 5th, or 7th asterisms may  \nalso cause death. The Lords of the 2nd and the 12th, counted from Kark, may bring death.

Should there  \nbe many Marakas and, if these Marakas are strong, there will be diseases, miseries etc. in major and sub-periods. Thus these are Marakas and are primarily  \nrelated to bring death upon the native. According to their dispositions there may be death, or difficulties. 22-24. Rahu and Ketu, as Marakas. If Rahu, or Ketu are  \nplaced in Tanu, Yuvati, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or happen to be in the 7th from a Marak Lord, or are placed with such a Grah, they acquire powers of killing in  \ntheir major, or sub-periods.

He will not, however, do so, if Rahu receives a Drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic. 25-31. Sahaj Bhava and Death. O excellent of Brahmins, if  \nSurya, being with strength, is in Sahaj Bhava, one will obtain his death, due to a king (legal punishments). Candr in Sahaj Bhava will cause death, due to  \ntuberculosis, while wounds, weapons, fire and thirst will cause death through Mangal in Sahaj Bhava. If Sahaj Bhava receives a Drishti from, or is occupied by Sani  \nand Rahu, death will be through poison, water, or fire, or fall from heights, or confinement. Death will surely come to descend through insects, or leprosy, if Candr  \nand Gulik occupy, or give a Drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Budh, giving a Drishti to, or occupying Sahaj Bhava, will bring death, followed by fever. Guru in Sahaj Bhava, or  \ngiving a Drishti to Sahaj Bhava, will cause death by swelling, or tumours. Urinary diseases will cause death, if Sukr is in, or gives a Drishti to Sahaj Bhava.

With other Grahas in Sahaj Bhava  \nthere will be unconsciousness before death. 34. According to Sahaj Bhava being a Movable, a Fixed, or a Dual Rashi, death will be, respectively, in a foreign place  \n(other than native birth place), in one\u2019s own house, or on the way. 35-36.

According to the following Grahas in Vyaya, Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different worlds after death: Guru  \nheaven, Candr, or Sukr the world of Manes, Mangal and/or Surya earth (rebirth), Budh and/or Sani hell.

Avasthas of Grahas \n \n1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have earlier stated, that the Avasthas, or states of the Grahas are to be considered in the context of the effects of the Grahas. Be so  \nkind to tell me about this. 2. O excellent of Brahmins, various kinds of Avasthas of the Grahas have been expounded. Out of these, I will give you the summary of  \nBaal (infant) and other states of the Grahas. 3. Baal, Kumar, Yuv, Vriddh and Mrit Avastha (Baal Adi Avasthas). Infant, youthful, adolescent, old and dead are the  \nstates of the Grahas, placed in the ascending order at the rate of six degrees in odd Rashis. In the case of even Rashis this arrangement is in reverse order.  \n(Vriddh - Advanced, Mrit - In extremis) 4. Results. One fourth, half, full, negligible and nil are the grades of the results, due to a Grah in infant, youthful, adolescent,  \nold and dead Avasthas. 5. Awakening, Dreaming and Sleeping States. If a Grah is in its own Rashi, or in exaltation, it is said to be in a state of awakening  \n(alertness). In the Rashi of a friend, or of a neutral it is in dreaming state, while in an enemy\u2019s Rashi, or in debilitation it is in a state of sleeping. 6. According to a  \nGrah, being in Awakening, Dreaming, or Sleeping states, the results, due to it will be full, medium, or nil. 7. Other Kinds of States. There are nine kinds of other  \nAvasthas, viz. Dipt, Swasth, Pramudit, Shanta, Din, Vikal, Duhkhit, Khal and Kop. 8-10. If a Grah is in its exaltation Rashi, it is in Dipt Avastha, if in its own Rashi, it  \nis in Swasth, if in a great friend\u2019s Rashi, it is in Pramudit, if in a friendly Rashi, it is in Shanta, if in a neutral Rashi, it is in Din, if a Grah is yuti with a malefic, it is in  \nVikal, if is in an enemy\u2019s Rashi, it is in Duhkhit, if in a great enemy\u2019s Rashi, it is in Khal and, if a Grah is being eclipsed by Surya, it is in Kop. Depending on such a  \nstate of the Grah, the Bhava, occupied by it will obtain corresponding effects. 11-18. Yet other Avasthas. Lajjit, Garvit, Kshudhit, Trushit, Mudit and Kshobhit are the  \nother kinds of Avasthas, due to the Grahas. Placed in Putr Bhava, if a Grah is associated with Rahu, or Ketu, or with Surya, Sani, or Mangal, it is in Lajjit Avastha. If  \na Grah is in exaltation, or in Mooltrikon, it is Garvit. If a Grah is in an enemy\u2019s Rashi, or yuti with an enemy, or receives a Drishti from an enemy, or even, if a Grah  \nis yuti with Sani, the Avastha is Kshudhit. If a Grah is in a watery Rashi and receives a Drishti from a malefic, but does not receive a Drishti from a benefic, the  \nAvastha is called Trushit. If a Grah is in a friendly Rashi, or is yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a benefic, or is yuti with Guru, it is said to be in Mudit Avastha.

Weak Grahas cause reduction in good effects, while stronger ones give greater effects. If a Grah, posited in Karm Bhava, is in Lajjit,  \nKshudhit Avastha, or Kshobhit Avastha, the person will always be subjected to miseries. If a Grah in Putr is in Lajjit, there will be destruction of progeny, or there will  \nbe only one surviving child.

A Grah in Garvit Avastha will cause happiness through new houses and gardens, regalhood, skill in arts, financial gains at  \nall times and improvement in business. A Grah in Mudit Avastha will give residences, clothes, ornaments, happiness from lands and wife, happiness from relatives,  \nliving in royal places, destruction of enemies and acquisition of wisdom and learning. A Grah in Lajjit will give aversion to God, loss of intelligence, loss of child,  \ninterest in evil speeches and listlessness in good things. A Grah in Kshobhit will give acute penury, evil disposition, miseries, financial debacles, distress to feet and  \nobstruction to income, due to royal wrath. A Grah in Kshudhit will cause downfall, due to grief and passion, grief on account of relatives, physical decline, troubles  \nfrom enemies, financial distress, loss of physical strength and an eclipsed mind, due to miseries. A Grah in Trushit Avastha will cause diseases through association  \nwith females, leading over wicked deeds, loss of wealth, due to one\u2019s own men, physical weakness, miseries, caused by evil people and decline of honour. 30-37.  \nCalculation of Shayan Adi Avasthas. Now I will tell you of the Avasthas, viz. Shayan, Upavesan, Netrapani, Prakash, Gaman, Agaman, Sabh, Agam, Bhojan, Nritya  \nLips, Kautuk and Nidr and the Chesthas of such Avasthas. Note the number of the star, occupied by the Grah, for which an Avastha is to be calculated. Multiply that  \nnumber by the number, denoted by the Grah (Surya 1 to Sani 7). The figure so arrived at should again be multiplied by the number of the Navans, where the Grah  \nis in. Add to this the number of the birth asterism (ruling star, the one, occupied by Candr), the number of Ghatis of birth and the number of Rashis, Lagn gained  \nfrom Mesh (Mesh 1, Vrishabh 2 and so forth). This figure should be divided by 12 and the remainder will indicate the corresponding Avastha of the Grah. The sub-\nstate in the said Avastha can be found out in the following way. Multiply the figure (Sayan 1 to Nidr 12), denoted by the Avastha concerned, by the same figure and  \nincrease it by the figure, denoted by the Anka value for the first syllable of the native\u2019s personal name. Divide the product so obtained by 12. The remainder thereof  \nshould be further increased by constant additives of the Grahas in the following way: Surya 5, Candr 2, Mangal 2, Budh 3, Guru 5, Sukr 3, Sani 3, Rahu (Ketu) 4.  \nThe product so arrived at should be divided by 3. In the process of calculation, if it happens, that the remainder is 1, it is Drishti, if 2, it is Chesht and, if 0, it is  \nVichesht.

Shayan Adi are of supreme importance, as compared to the other kinds of Avasthas. In place of Navans, given above, some translators interpret  \nthe word Ans, as degree, occupied by the Grah, which is obviously not correct. In this connection the reader\u2019s attention is drawn to Balabhadr\u2019s Hora Ratna, Ch. 3,  \nwherein the author, Balabhadr himself, gives an example for Surya, being in the 7th Navans of Simh and thus he considered only 7, as multiplier. He quotes  \nAdhibhut Sagara, as his authority for calculation of Sayan Adi. Agaman Avastha is known, as Gamanechch by some exponents. Anka value is 1 for a, ka, cha, ? a,  \ndha, bha and va, 2 for i, kha, ja, ?ha, na, ma and sha, 3 for u, ga, jha, ta, pa, ya and sa, 4 for e, gha, ? a, tha, pha, ra and sa, 5 for o, ca, ?ha, da, ba, la and ha. 38-\n39. Effects of Chesht etc. If the sub-state is Drishti in an Avastha, the results, being stated for the Avastha, will be medium, the effects will be full in Chesht and  \nnegligible in Vichesht. The good and bad effects of Grahas should be deciphered, based on the strength and weakness of the Grahas. In exaltation the Grahas  \nreveal effects in a pronounced manner, due to Avasthas. 40-51. Effects of Surya\u2019s Avasthas. If Surya is in Sayan Avastha, the native will incur digestive deficiency,  \nmany diseases, stoutness of legs, bilious vitiation, ulcer in the anus and heart strokes; if in Upavesan, will suffer poverty, will carry loads, will indulge in litigations,  \nbe hard-hearted, wicked and will lose in his undertakings; if is in Netrapani, will always be happy, wise, helpful to others, endowed with prowess and wealth, very  \nhappy and will gain royal favours; if in Prakash, will be liberal in disposition, have plenty of wealth, be a significant speaker in the assembly, will perform many  \nmeritorious acts, be greatly strong and endowed with charming beauty; if in Gaman, will be disposed to live in foreign places, be miserable, indolent, bereft of  \nintelligence and wealth, be distressed, due to fear and will be short-tempered; if in Agaman, will be interested in others\u2019 wives, be devoid of his own men, be  \ninterested in movements and skilful in doing evil deeds, be dirty, ill-disposed and will be a talebearer; if in Sabh, will be disposed to help others, be always endowed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c722ebd4-fefe-4c5f-80bd-25bf89ca7dc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c722ebd4-fefe-4c5f-80bd-25bf89ca7dc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e8dabeb-fb84-4212-b5cd-b390af16b5ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "271bcc53dc39b18ad2f9dbb9fda74584ee5ab89df8a434333b58f71ea537d691"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4ca6796-7947-4350-8aa8-fb53638811cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "f743c3b01d16e7f986b1c3e64a37f9caf772e1632bea44bde91a10e7a2d54600"}}, "hash": "8f7c385ebf72a008c25ae9fc57e2c636905cf6db173b8ee47b5a4f6ee7b33eb9", "text": "with wealth and gems, be virtuous, endowed with lands, new houses and robes, be very strong, very affectionate to his friends and very kindly disposed; if in Agam,  \nwill be distressed, due to enemies, fickle-minded, evil-minded, emaciated, devoid of virtuous acts and intoxicated with pride; if in Bhojan, will experience pains in  \njoints, will lose money on account of others\u2019 females, will have strength, declining off and on, be untruthful, will incur head-aches, eat remnant food and will take to  \nbad ways; if in Nritya Lips, will be honoured by the learned, be a scholar, will have knowledge of poetry etc. and will be adored by kings on the earth; if is Kautuk,  \nwill always be happy, will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge and will perform Yagyas, will move amidst kings, have fear from enemies, will be charming-faced and  \nbe endowed with knowledge of poetry; if in Nidr, will have a strong tendency towards being drowsy, will live in foreign (distant) places, will incur harm to his wife and  \nwill face financial destruction. Surya in Upavesan will make one an artisan, black in complexion, devoid of learning and miserable. One will serve others. In  \nNetrapani there will be all kinds of happiness, if Surya is in Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati. In other Bhavas Netrapani of Surya will give eye diseases and enmity with  \nall. If Surya is in Prakash, the native will be meritorious, religious and liberal, will enjoy pleasures, be equal to a prince and will enjoy the status of Kuber, the God of  \nwealth. However, the Prakash of Surya, placed in Yuvati, or Putr will cause loss of the first child and will produce many litigations. If Surya is in Gaman, the native  \nwill incur disease of the feet and will be very mean. If in Agaman, Surya in Vyaya, or in Yuvati will destroy progeny and will give very limited wealth. If in Agam,  \nSurya will give many miseries, an ugly appearance and foolishness. However, he will give wealth. Surya in Bhojan in Dharm will cause many hindrances to spiritual  \nand religious undertakings. In other Bhavas Surya in Bhojan will cause head and ear diseases, apart from joint pains. Though Maharishi Parashar states, that the  \nnative with Surya in Kautuk Avastha will have fear from enemies, Bal Bhadr exempts such evil effect for the Ari Bhava position. Surya in Kautuk in other Bhavas will  \ngive a number of daughters, two wives, itch, excellence, liberality etc. If Surya is in Nidr, the native will be predisposed to incur piles and elephantiasis, will  \nexperience a lack of peace and he will be liable to lose his first child. 52-63. Effects of Candr\u2019s Avasthas. If Candr is in Sayan, the native will be honourable,  \nsluggish, given to sexual lust and he will face financial destruction; if in Upavesan, will be troubled by diseases, be dull-witted, not endowed with mentionable  \nwealth, will be hard-hearted, will do unworthy acts and will steal others\u2019 wealth; if in Netrapani, will be troubled by great diseases (long lasting in nature), be very  \ngarrulous, wicked and will indulge in bad deeds. Should Candr be in Prakash, the native will be famous in the world, will have his virtues exposed through royal  \npatronage, will be surrounded by horses, elephants, females and ornaments, will visit shrines.

Effects of the Avasthas of Mangal. If Mangal is in Sayan, the native will be troubled by wounds, itch and ulcer. If Mangal is  \nplaced in Upavesan, the native will be strong, sinful, untruthful, eminent, wealthy and bereft of virtues. If Mangal is placed in Lagn and happens to be in Netrapani,  \nthere will be penury; if placed in other Bhavas, Netrapani will confer rulership of a city.

Should Mangal be in Upavesan in Lagn, the native will be extremely  \nsinful and he will incur several diseases, will be indigent and not peaceful. If Upavesan occurs for Mangal in Dharm, the native will lose his whole wealth apart from  \nhis wife and progeny. Mangal in Netrapani in Lagn will give poverty and will destroy the native\u2019s wife and progeny; if Mangal is in Netrapani in other Bhavas, this  \nconfers on the native all kinds of wealth and happiness from wife and children. The Dhan, or Yuvati position of Mangal in Netrapani will cause fear from lions and  \nsnakes apart from giving earnings from lands. Furthermore the native\u2019s wife will predecease him. Should Mangal be in Prakash in Putr, or in Yuvati, the native will  \nlose his wife and all children. If Mangal is placed in Putr in Prakash and is yuti with Sani, the native will kill cows.

If Mangal is in Bhojan, or in Sayan in Putr, or in Randhr, there will be untimely death for the native. In other Bhavas Bhojan of Mangal  \nwill confer wealth. Should Mangal be in Nritya Lips and happens to be in Lagn, Dhan, Yuvati, or Karm, the native will receive all kinds of happiness; there will be  \nmiseries in abundance, if Mangal is in Nritya Lips and placed in Randhr, or Dharm, apart from incurring untimely death. In other Bhavas Nritya Lips of Mangal will  \nmake the native akin to Kuber. Mangal in Yuvati, or in Dharm in Kautuk will give several diseases and death of the first child and wife. In other Bhavas Kautuk will  \nconfer scholarship, various kinds of wealth, two wives and more female children. In Nidr Mangal in Lagn, Dhan, Sahaj, Dharm, Karm, or Labh will give scholarship,  \nfoolishness and poverty. Putr, or Yuvati placement of Mangal in Nidr will give many miseries and many male children.

Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar! You are omniscient. There is no subject, with which you are not conversant. Therefore now please favour me  \nwith guidance about the different kinds of Dashas (periods) of the various Grahas. 2-5. Maharishi Parashar replied. O Brahmin! Dashas are of many kinds. Amongst  \nthem Vimshottari is the most appropriate for the general populace. But the other Dashas, followed in special cases, are Astottari, Shodshottari, Dwadashottari,  \nPanchottari, Shatabdik, Chaturashiti-sama, Dwisaptati-sama, Shastihayani, Shat-trimshat-sama. Our ancients have described these different kinds of Dashas,  \nbased on Nakshatras. 6-11. O Brahmin! Some Maharishis have made a mention of Kala and Chakr Dasha, but they have recognized the Kala Chakr Dasha, as  \nsupreme. The other kinds of Dashas, propagated by the sages, are Char, Sthir, Kendr, Karak, Brahma Grah, Manduk, Shul, Yogardh, Drig, Trikon, Rashi,  \nPanchswara, Yogini, Pind, Nausargik, Asht Varg, Sandhya, Pachak, Tara etc. But in our view all these Dashas are not appropriate. Vimshottari 12-14. Beginning  \nfrom Kritika, the Lords of Dashas are Surya, Candr, Mangal, Rahu, Guru, Sani, Budh, Ketu and Sukr in that order. Thus, if the Nakshatras from Kritika to the Janm  \nNakshatr are divided by nine, the remainder will signify the Lord of the commencing Dasha. The remaining Dashas will be of the Grahas in the order, given above.  \nIn Kali Yuga the natural life-span of a human being is generally taken, as 120 years. Therefore Vimshottari Dasha is considered to be the most appropriate and the  \nbest of all Dashas. 15. The periods of Dashas of Surya, Candr, Mangal, Rahu, Guru, Sani, Budh, Ketu and Sukr are 6, 10, 7, 18, 16, 19, 17, 7 and 20 in that order.  \n16. To find out the remainder of the Dasha, operating at the time of birth, first find out the expired portion of the Dasha of the concerned Grah. This is done, as  \nfollows. Multiply the Dasha period of the Grah concerned by the period of the stay of Candr in Janm Nakshatr, that has expired and divide that amount by the total  \nperiod of the stay of Candr in that Nakshatr. The figure in years, months etc. so arrived at will be the expired period of the Dasha. If this figure is deducted from the  \ntotal period of the Dasha, we will get the balance of Dasha at the time of birth. Ashtottari 17-20. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin, the sages have recommended  \nthe adoption of Ashtottari, when Rahu not being in Lagn, in any other Kendr, or Trikon to the Lord of the Lagn. From 4 Nakshatras from Ardra commences the  \nDasha of Surya, from 3 after that begins the Dasha of Candr, 4 after that will bring the Dasha of Mangal, 3 after that the Lord of Dasha will be Budh, 4 therefrom will  \nhave Sani, as the Dasha Lord, 3 thereafter the Lord will be Guru, Rahu will be the Lord of the Dasha 4 Nakshatras after that and then Sukr will take over the  \nlordship of the Dasha 3 Nakshatras from the last one mentioned above.

Thus in  \nthis Dasha system only 8 Grahas play the role of Dasha Lords, Ketu having been denied this privilege. 21-22. The Dashas of the various Grahas have been  \nspecified above. In the case of malefic Grahas the Dasha span of one Nakshatr is \u00bc of the Dasha of the Grah. It is 1/3rd in the case of benefics. Thus the expired  \nportion of the Dasha is calculated, according to the method, followed for Vimshottari Dasha, by multiplying the Bhayat, i.e. the expired period of the stay of Candr in  \nthe Janm Nakshatr, by the Dasha portion of the Janm Nakshatr and dividing it by Bhabhog, i.e. the total period of the stay of Candr in the Janm Nakshatr. Then the  \nbalance of Dasha at birth can also be ascertained. If Uttarashadha happens to be the Janm Nakshatr, the duration of its first three Padas is taken, as Bhabhog and  \nthe Dasha calculations should be done accordingly. The Dasha and calculations for Abhijit Nakshatr are done by taking the 4th Pad of Uttarashadha plus the 15th  \npart of the beginning of Shravan. For Shravan the Bhabhog would be the total of its duration in Ghatikas minus the 1/15th part of the beginning of Shravan.  \nShodshottari 23. It will be advisable to adopt the Shodshottari, if the birth is in the day in Krishna Paksh (dark half of the month), or at night in Shukla Paksh (bright  \nhalf). 24-26. The Dasha may be adopted, when the Lagn is in the Hora of Candr with birth in the Krishna Paksh, or, when Lagn is in the Hora of Surya with birth in  \nthe Shukla Paksh.

Now, after making obedience to Lord Shiva, I shall describe the Kala Chakr Dasha. Whatever was  \nrelated by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvati, is being explained by me for the use of sages to be utilized for the welfare of the people. 54-55.

Then Nakshatras may be incorporated in the manner, indicated hereafter.  \nThese Kundalis, indicative of the 12 Rashis, are called Kala Chakr. 56-58. Write Ashvini, Bharani and Kritika in the Savya Chakr and Rohini, Mrigashira, Ardra in  \nthe Apsavya. Then incorporate the three following Nakshatras, Punarvasu, Pushya and Aslesha in the Savya and Magha, Purvaphalguni and Uttaraphalguni in the  \nApsavya.

The Padas of Ashvini, Punarvasu, Hast, Mul, Purvabhadrapad, Kritika, Aslesha, Swati,  \nUttarashadha and Revati of the Savya should be reckoned in the same manner, as the Padas of Ashvini. 59.

O Brahmin!  \nThe description of the Deha and Jiva of the Padas of the Apsavya Nakshatras and the Dasha Lords is the same, as narrated by Lord Mahadeva to Goddess  \nParvati. 83. Maitreya said. O Venerable Maharishi Parashar! Now please guide me about the Dasha spans of the Dasha Lords, described by you. Please also  \ndemonstrate, how the commencement of the Dasha, its expired and the remaining periods at the birth are to be calculated. 84. Maharishi Parashar said. 5, 21, 7, 9,  \n10, 16 and 4 years are the Dasha spans of Surya, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Guru, Sukr and Sani. 85-86. The span of life of a person is determined from the Padas  \n(Ansas) of the Nakshatr at the time of birth, or the time of query and the years allotted to the 9 Rashis, commencing from it (the Pad of the Nakshatr). Some sages  \nare of the view, that the person will enjoy full span of life (Purna Ayu), if his birth is at the commencement of the Padas, will have middle span of life (Madhaya Ayu),  \nif the birth is in the middle of the Padas and short span of life (\u2018Alap Ayu\u2019), or will face death-like sufferings, if the birth is at the end of the Padas of the Nakshatr. 87-\n88. According to this principle, we should be acquainted with the Padas of the Nakshatras. Now I shall tell you, how the calculations are made, according to the  \nproportion of the Padas of a Nakshatr. The number of Ashvini etc., whichever may be the past Nakshatras, should be divided by 3. Thereafter the remainder should  \nbe multiplied by 4.

In the Savya Chakr the first Ans is called Deha and the last  \nJiva. The opposite is the case in the Apsavya Chakr. Therefore the calculations should be based on the Deha etc. in the Savya Chakr and on the Jiva etc. in  \nApsavya. We give below the Savya and Apsavya Kaal Chakr Charts. For Example. The birth is in Mrigashira 4th Pad. It is in the Apsavya Kaal Chakr. The Lord of  \nDeha is Mangal and that of Jiva is Guru. The Bhabhog of Mrigashira is 59/31 (59 Ghatikas 31 Palas) and Bhayat is 58/15 (58 Ghatikas 15 Palas). \u00bc of the Bhabhog  \ncomes to 14/52/44. That would be the value of one Pad. Multiplying this by 3 will get Ghatikas of 3 Padas, namely 44/38/15. Deducting this from Bhayat, the past  \nGhatikas, Palas etc. of the 4th Pad will be 13/36/45. The full Dasha years are 100. Multiplying this by 13/36/45 we get 1300/3600/4500 = 1361/15. This divided by  \n15 will give the expired period at birth, namely 90 years and 9 months. See the Kaal Chakr. There we count from Jiva etc. to Deha. In the 4th Pad of Mrigashira Jiva  \nis in Dhanu and Deha in Mesh. Therefore, by deducting the total of years from Dhanu to Mithun, namely 77, from 90 years 9 months, we get the expired period of  \nVrishabh, namely 13 years and 9 months. By deducting this from the present 16 years of Sukr, we will get 2 years and 3 months, as the balance of Dasha at birth.  \nAccordingly, like Vimshottari Dasha, the order of Dasha will be Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Vrischik etc. For Example. Suppose, that at the time of birth of a person in  \nKritika Nakshatr the longitude of Candr (Candr Spast) is 1r4\u00b050\u2019. This converted into Kalas will be 2090 at birth. The Dasha should be taken, as commencing from  \nthat. Divide the Kalas by 800 (1 Nakshatr). The result will be the 2nd Nakshatr, namely Bharini and the remainder will be 490. These will be the past Kalas of  \nKritika. There are 200 Kalas in one Pad (Navans). Divide 490, the past Kalas of Kritika, by 200. We will then get 2, as past Padas and the remainder 90 will  \nrepresent the past Kalas of the present Nakshatr. By multiplying this by 83, the Dasha years, we will get 7470, which, divided by 200, will indicate the expired  \nportion of the Dasha, as 37 years, 4 months and 6 days.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bca61667-ff03-452f-a337-55f1e672c64c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bca61667-ff03-452f-a337-55f1e672c64c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27e49d88-839d-4101-96a6-3db670a74231", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "813e69abf57757f9396aee5fc59fb551b67c0c41dbdd9c5295601cf96511b23a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0453d80c-215f-405c-98bb-a7c18c5af4e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "977b8abf5e7d05288270069f5147cda6fea9d1ea66b6ff8a21b88724c43b4fd7"}}, "hash": "a9da15c566af76f2c6b6ac78df18ee9cc1a456fb06f93d0510e3ad279e45ccf3", "text": "By deducting the years of Dehans, commencing from Vrishabh, in the order Vrishabh, Mesh, Meen,  \nKumbh (16+7+10+4 = 37), we will get 0 years, 4 months and 6 days.

See in this connection the Savya Kaal Chakr. Gati of Rashis in the Kaal Chakr  \n96-98. There are three kinds of movements (Gati) of the Rashis in the Kaal Chakr, namely Manduki, Markati and Simhavlokan. The movement of one Rashi by  \njumping over one Rashi is known, as Manduki Gati. Backward movement to the previous Rashi is called Markati Gati. The movement of a Rashi to the 5th and 9th  \nRashi is said to be Simhavlokan. 99-100. Movement from Kanya to Kark and from Simh to Mithun is Manduki Gati. Movement from Simh to Kark is Markati Gati.  \nMovement from Meen to Vrischik and from Dhanu to Mesh is called Simhavlokan Gati. Effects of Dashas of Rashis, as a Result of these Gati 101-102. The effects  \nof the Dasha of the Rashis with Manduki Gati in the Savya Chakr are distress to friends, relations, parents and elders and there is likely to be cause for trouble from  \npoison, weapons, thieves and enemies. In the Manduki Dasha of the Gati of a Rashi from Simh to Mithun there is the likelihood of the death of the mother, or self,  \ntrouble from Government and possibility of brain fever. 103. The effects of the Dasha of Rashi with Markati Gati in the Savya Chakr are loss of wealth, agricultural  \nproducts and animals, death of father, or an elderly close relation and feeling of lethargy. 104-105. The effects of the Dasha of the Rashis with Simhavlokan Gati in  \nthe Savya Chakr are possibility of injury from animals, loss of amity with friends, distress to near relations, drowning in a well, fall from animals, possibility of harm  \nfrom poison, weapons and diseases and destruction of residential dwelling. 106-108. In the Dasha of the Rashis with the Manduki Gati in the Apsavya Chakr the  \neffects will be distress to wife and conditions, loss of children, possibility of feverish conditions and loss of position. In the Dasha of the Rashis with the Markati Gati  \nthere may be danger from watery places, loss of position, distress from father, punishment from Government and wandering in the forests; with the Simhavlokan  \nthere may be destruction of the dwelling and death of father etc. 109-111. If the movement is from Meen to Vrischik, the native may suffer from fever; if from Kanya  \nto Kark, there may be loss of brothers and kinsmen; if from Simh to Mithun, there may be ill health of the wife; if from Simh to Kark, the native may die; if from  \nDhanu to Mesh, there may be death of uncles and similar relations. If the Rashi is yuti with a malefic, adverse conditions may be expected in the Dasha of the  \nRashi. Favourable effects will be felt in its Dasha, if the Rashi is yuti with a benefic. 112-113.

Four malefics in the Deha and Jiva Rashi will cause  \ndefinite death. If both the Deha and Jiva Rashis are occupied by malefics, there will be fear from king and thieves and death of the native. If Surya is in the Deha, or  \nJiva Rashi, there will be danger from fire. Candr in the Deha, or Jiva Rashi will cause danger from water, Mangal fear from weapons, Budh fear from windy troubles,  \nSani fear from Gulma (a disease), Rahu and Ketu fear from poison. If the Deha, or Jiva Rashis are occupied by Budh, Guru and Sukr, the native will be wealthy, will  \nenjoy all kinds of comforts and will have good health. Mixed results may be expected, if the Deha and Jiva Rashis are occupied by both benefics and malefics. 129-\n130. In the Dasha of the Rashis, owned by malefics, the body and soul will be in distress.

The principle for considering the Bal of the  \nRashi is, that the Fixed Rashi is considered stronger than the Movable one and the Dual Rashi is considered more powerful than the Fixed Rashi. If there is  \nequality in the strength of the Rashis, then to determine the number of years of Dasha counting should be done up to the Rashi with bigger number. If one Rashi is  \noccupied by a Grah in exaltation, the counting should be done up to that Rashi only. In addition 1 should be added in the number of years in the case of a Rashi  \nwith an exalted Grah and 1 should be deducted from the number of years in the case of a Rashi with a Grah in debilitation. The prediction should be made after  \ncalculating the Dashas in this manner. 167. If the Rashi in Dharm Bhava is in an odd Pad, the counting should be from the Rashi in the Lagn onwards. The counting  \nwould be in the reverse order, if the Pad is even. The Dashas of Rashis have to be fixed, keeping this in view. For Example. In the above Tula is the Rashi in  \nDharm Bhava in an odd Pad. Amongst the Lords of Lagn, Sani and Rahu, Rahu is associated with a Grah. Therefore Rahu is more powerful than, Sani. Therefore  \ncounting should be done up to Rahu. Kumbh is in even Pad, therefore counting has to be done from Kumbh up to Rahu in the reverse order, by which the Char  \nDasha for Kumbh would come to 8 years. Mesh is in odd Pad. Therefore the Char Dasha for Mesh will be one year. The Dasha of other Rashis should be  \ncalculated in the same manner. Sthir 168-169. Maharishi Parashar said. Now I am going to describe the Sthir Dasha. In this Dasha system 7, 8 and 9 years are the  \nDasha spans of the Movable (Char), Fixed (Sthir) and Dual (Dvisva Bhava) Rashis. In this system the Dasha of the 12 Rashis begins from the Brahm Grah Ashrit  \nRashi. The Dashas are counted onwards from the odd Rashis and in the reverse order from the even Rashis. 170-173. Maitreya said. O great Sage! Now please  \nenlighten me how the Brahm Grah is picked out in a chart. Maharishi Parashar said. From amongst the Lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya the Grah, who may possess  \nthe greatest strength and is placed in Lagn, or in Yuvati with strength, the one, placed in an odd Rashi within sixth Bhava from the Bhava concerned, is called the  \nBrahm Grah. The Lord of Randhr in Randhr is also accepted, as Brahm Grah. If Sani, or Rahu/Ketu obtain Brahmatva (qualifications of Brahm Grah), they become  \nBrahm Grah. If a number of Grahas obtain Brahmatva, the one with the largest number of degrees would become Brahm Grah. If there is parity in the degrees of  \nsuch Grahas, the most powerful amongst them would become Brahm Grah. Yogardha 174. The spans of Dashas of the Rashis in the Yogardha Dasha system are  \nhalf of the total of the spans of Char and Sthir Dashas.

In calculating the years of Dashas of Grahas, counting is done from the Grah to his own Rashi. The years of  \nDashas would be the number, arrived at by counting up to the Rashi of the Grah, which is stronger, or more in number. 177. If a Grah owns two Rashis, the Dasha  \nyears will be equal to the number, which is greater, when counted from the Rashi, occupied by him. Notes. Under this system Dashas are of two kinds, namely  \nLagn Kendradi and Atma Karak Kendradi. There are also Kendradi Rashi Dasha, or Kendradi Grah Dasha in both the Dasha systems, mentioned above. Karak  \n178. The system, under which the first Dasha is of the Atma Karak and the subsequent Dashas are of the remaining 7 Karakas in their order is known, as Karak  \nDasha. In this system the Dasha years are equal to the number of Rashis, counted from Lagn up to the Karak concerned. Manduk 179-180. Under the Manduk  \nDasha system the Dasha commences from Lagn, or Yuvati Bhava, whichever is stronger. If the Rashi of commencement is an odd Rashi, the Dashas of 3  \nMovable, 3 Fixed and 3 Dual Rashis will be counted in the onwards order.

In this system every Dasha is of the next 3rd Rashi. Shula 181-182. Some sages have designed the Shula Dasha for  \ndetermining the time of death. In this system the Dasha commences from Dhan, or Randhr, whichever is stronger. If the Rashi is an odd one, the order of the  \nDasha Rashis will be onwards. It will be backwards in the case of an even Rashi. The Dasha years in this system are, as adopted for the Sthir Dasha. There is a  \npossibility, that death appears in the Dasha of the Marak Rashi, which has greater strength. Trikon 183-184. In this system the first Dasha commences from the  \nstrongest amongst the Rashis in Kon (Trikon) to Lagn (Tanu, Putr and Dharm). This system is similar to the Char Dasha. Here also the Dashas of the Rashis will be  \nin the onwards order in the case of odd Rashis and in the reverse order in the case of even Rashis. The Dasha years will be similar to that of Char Dasha. It has  \nbeen named Trikon because of the commencement of the Dasha from the Rashis in Konas. Dirga 185-187. In this system the order of the Dashas is, as follows:  \nthe Rashi, occupying Dharm, the Rashis, receiving a Drishti from the Rashi in Dharm, the Rashi in Karm, the Rashis, receiving a Drishti from the Rashi in Karm, the  \nRashi in Labh and the Rashis, receiving a Drishti from the Rashi in Labh. As this system is mostly based on Drishtis, it has been named, as Dirga Dasha. Three  \ndifferent processes are adopted for the Movable, Fixed and Dual Rashis from Dharm, Karm and Labh. According to them, Rashi, which receives a Drishti from the  \nMovable Rashi, is counted backwards and the Rashi, receiving a Drishti from the Fixed Rashi, is counted onwards. In the case of the Dual Rashi, if it is odd, the  \ncounting is onwards and the order is backwards in case of an even Rashi for the Rashis, receiving a Drishti. Notes. The intention is, that from the point of view of  \nDrishti the process of Rashi, receiving a Drishti, should be started from the Rashi, which is nearest. In this connection readers may refer to Rashi Drishtikathan  \nAdhyaya, Ch. 8, Verse 9 and the table after that. Lagnadi Rashi Dasha 188-189. In this system there are Dashas of all the 12 Rashis, including Lagn, in every  \nNakshatr. Consequently the Bhayat at birth may be multiplied by 12 and then the product should be divided by Bhabhog. The Rashi, degree etc. so available may  \nbe added to the longitude of Lagn. From the Rashi, becoming available by doing so, will start the Dashas of the 12 Rashis. (If that Rashi is odd, the counting will be  \nonwards. It will be in the reverse order, if the Rashi is even) 190. For finding the balance of Dasha at birth, multiply the expired degree etc. by the Dasha years of  \nthe first Dasha Rashi and divide it by 30. The years etc. so arrived at may be deducted from the Dasha years. The result will indicate the balance of Dasha at birth  \nin years, months etc. Panch Swar Dasha 191-194.

In the Dasha of every Swar there will be Antar Dashas of all the five Swaras in the same  \norder. Yogini 195-199. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already given you the description of Panch Swar Dasha. Now I will acquaint you with the Yogini  \nDasha, as described by Lord Mahadeva. There are 8 Yoginis, namely Mangal, Pingal, Dhanya, Bhramari, Bhadrika, Ulka, Siddha and Sankat. Candr, Surya, Guru,  \nMangal, Budh, Sani, Sukr and Rahu are born from them. Add 3 to the Janm Nakshatr and divide it by 8. The remainder will indicate the Yogini Dasha of Mangal,  \netc. The Dashas are of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years. The balance of Dasha at birth should be worked out from the Bhayat and Bhabhog etc., as already explained  \nearlier. Pind, Ans and Nisarg 201-202. The Pind, Ans and Nisarg Dasha will be the same, as Pindayu, Ansayu and Nisargayu, the method of determination of which  \nhas already been explained previously. The order of Dashas will be, as follows. The first will be of Lagn, Surya, or Candr, whoever is stronger. The subsequent  \nDashas will be of Grahas in Kendr to them, then of Grahas in Panaphara Bhavas and lastly in Apoklima Bhavas. The Dashas and Antar Dashas of Lagn and the  \nseven Grahas will also be in the same order. 203. The effects of these Dashas will be in accordance with Ashtak Varg Bal, which subject will be dealt with later.  \nThese Dashas are also called Ashtak Varg Dashas. Sandhya 204. Sandhya is the Dvadashans Ayurdaya of the Param Ayurdaya (maximum possible life-span). In  \nSandhya Dasha the Dasha of all the Rashis from Lagn onwards is of 1/12 the years of Param Ayurdaya. Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha 205-206. By multiplying  \nthe Dasha years of Sandhya Dasha by 6 and dividing the product by 31, the years, months etc. so arrived at may be put in one apartment of a Table. Thereafter  \nhalf of these years, months etc. may be written in the next three apartments. The remaining 8 apartments may be filled in by one third of the aforesaid years,  \nmonths etc. In this manner Pachak Dasha in Sandhya Dasha of every Bhava can be worked out and predictions may be made from it. Tar 207-209. O Brahmin!  \nSome sages have given consideration to Tar Dasha, which is like Vimshottari. In this Dasha Janm, Sampat etc. in their order replace Surya, Candr etc., placed in  \nKendras. This Dasha is applied in those cases only, where there are Grahas in Kendras. If there are a number of Grahas, the first Dasha will belong to the  \nstrongest amongst them. 210. O Brahmin! I have now completed the description of the different kinds of Dashas. I will give the description of their Antar Dashas  \n(sub-periods) later. \n \nCh. 47. Effects of Dashas \n \n1. Maitreya said.

O Brahmin! There are two kinds of effects of Dashas: general and distinctive. The natural characteristics of the Grahas cause the  \ngeneral effects and the distinctive effects are realized by their placements etc. 3-4. The effects of the Dashas of the Grahas are in accordance with their strength.  \nThe effects of a Grah in the first Dreshkan are realized at the commencement of the Dasha. The Grah in the second Dreshkan makes its effects felt in the middle of  \nthe Dasha. The effects of the Grah in the third Dreshkan are experienced at the end of the Dasha. If the Grah is retrograde, these effects would be in the reverse  \norder. The Dasha effects of Rahu and Ketu, who are always retrograde, will always be realized in the reverse order. 5-6. The effects are favourable, if at the  \ncommencement of the Dasha the Dasha Lord is in Lagn, in his exaltation, own, or a Shant Rashi. The results are unfavourable, if the Dasha Lord is in Ari, Randhr,  \nor Vyaya Bhava, in his debilitation, or in an inimical Rashi. 7-11. During the Dasha of Surya there is acquisition of wealth, great felicity and honours from the  \nGovernment, if at the time of birth Surya is in his own Rashi, in his exaltation Rashi, in a Kendr, in Labh, be associated with the Lord of Dharm, or the Lord of Karm  \nand strong in his Varg. The native will be blessed with a son (children), if Surya is with the Lord of Putr. The native will acquire elephants and other kinds of wealth,  \nif Surya is associated with the Lord of Dhan. The native will enjoy comforts of conveyances, if Surya is associated with the Lord of Bandhu. He attains a high  \nposition, like that of Army Chief, by the beneficence of the king and enjoys all kinds of happiness. Thus during the Dasha of a strong (and favourable) Surya there  \nare acquisitions of clothes, agricultural products, wealth, honours, conveyances etc. 12-15. During the Dasha of Surya there will be anxieties, loss of wealth,  \npunishment from Government, defamation, opposition by kinsmen, distress to father, (in)auspicious happenings at home, distress to paternal and maternal uncles  \netc., anxiety and inimical relations with other people for no reason whatsoever, should Surya be in his Rashi of debilitation, be weak in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, or be  \nassociated with malefic Grahas, or with the Lord of Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya. There will be some favourable effects at times, if in the above situations Surya receives a  \nDrishti from benefic Grahas. The effects will always be unfavourable, when malefic Grahas give a Drishti to Surya. 16-22. O Brahmin! After describing the effects of  \nthe Dasha of Surya in brief, I will now come to the effects of Vimshottari Dasha of Candr. During the Dasha of Candr from its commencement to the end there will  \nbe opulence and glory, good fortune, gain of wealth, auspicious functions at home, dawn of fortune, attainment of a high position in Government, acquisition of  \nconveyances, clothes, birth of children and acquisition of cattle, should Candr be in her exaltation, in her own Rashi, in Kendr, in Labh, Dharm, or Putr, be  \nassociated with, or receives a Drishti from benefics, be fully powerful and is associated with the Lord of Karm, Dharm, or Bandhu. There will be extraordinary gains  \nof wealth and luxuries, if such a Candr is in Dhan Bhava. 23-26. Should Candr be waning, or in her debilitation Rashi, there will be loss of wealth in her Dasha.

The exaltation Rashi of Rahu is Vrishabh. The  \nexaltation Rashi of Ketu is Vrischik. The Multrikonas of Rahu and Ketu are Mithun and Dhanu. The own Rashis of Rahu and Ketu are Kumbh and Vrischik. Some  \nsages have expressed the view, that Kanya is the own Rashi of Rahu and Meen is the own Rashi of Ketu. Should Rahu be in his exaltation Rashi etc., there will be  \nduring the Dasha of Rahu great happiness from acquisition of wealth, agricultural products etc., acquisition of conveyances with  the help of friends and  \nGovernment, construction of a new house, birth of sons (children), religious inclinations, recognition from Government of foreign countries and gain of wealth,  \nclothes etc. If Rahu be associated with, or receives a Drishti from benefics, be in a benefic Rashi and be in Tanu, Bandhu, Yuvati, Karm, Labh, or Sahaj, there will  \nbe during his Dasha all kinds of comforts by the beneficence of the Government, acquisition of wealth through a foreign Government, or sovereign and felicity at  \nhome. 40-43. If Rahu is in Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, there will be during his Dasha all kinds of troubles and distress. If Rahu is associated with a malefic, or a Marak  \nGrah, or is in his debilitation Rashi, there will be loss of position, destruction of his residential house, mental agony, trouble to wife and children and misfortune of  \ngetting bad food. There will be loss of wealth at the commencement of the Dasha, some relief and gain of wealth in his own country and distress and anxieties  \nduring the last portion of the Dasha. 44. Now I am going to describe the effects of the Dasha of Guru, the great benefic and preceptor of the Gods. 45-48. If Guru is  \nin his exaltation, his own Rashi, his Multrikon, in Karm, Putr, or Dharm Bhava, in his own Navans, or in his exalted Navans, there will be during his Dasha:  \nacquisition of kingdom, great felicity, recognition by Government, acquisition of conveyances and clothes, devotion to deities and Brahmins, happiness in respect of  \nhis wife and children and success in the performance of religious sacrifices (oblations). 49-51. If Guru is in his debilitation Rashi, combust, associated with malefics,  \nor in Ari, or Randhr, there will be during his Dasha loss of residential premises, anxiety, distress to children, loss of cattle and pilgrimage. The Dasha will give some  \nunfavourable effects at its commencement only. During the later part of the Dasha there will be good effects, like gain of wealth, awards from and recognition by  \nGovernment. 52. Now I will describe to you the effects of the Dasha of Sani, who is considered the vilest and most inferior amongst all the Grahas. 53-56. If Sani is  \nin his exaltation, in his own Rashi, or in Multrikon, or friendly Rashi, in his own, or exalted Navans and in Sahaj, or Labh, there will be during his Dasha recognition  \nby Government, opulence and glory, name and fame, success in the educational sphere, acquisition of conveyances and ornaments etc., gain of wealth, favours  \nfrom Government, attainment of a high position, like Commander of an Army, acquisition of a kingdom, benevolence of goddess Lakshmi, gain of property and birth  \nof children. 57-60. If Sani is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, in his debilitation Rashi, or combust, there will be during his Dasha ill effects from poison, injury from  \nweapons, separation from father, distress to wife and children, disaster, as a result of displeasure of Government, imprisonment etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "096ea5fd-9a00-47a5-b7bc-e26f28a1515e": {"__data__": {"id_": "096ea5fd-9a00-47a5-b7bc-e26f28a1515e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0919995-67d3-4bd6-85ca-33ecbe7e57b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "146ed8fbf31ecfe214a408c28dbda671916bdc38ba2b65fae9b2f05ff1017530"}, "2": {"node_id": "74ea1378-0554-4a58-8531-b7809436b969", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "38c5b75bb5dbd3a905a9d4d665e658cc1cffdb49f954ac8da8826c94cffa3583"}, "3": {"node_id": "301f5bf2-9bda-465d-a337-eeadb971688e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "a6743b68b01778c361462230665c1fd9e9be148af890a55eccd9083174e12e12"}}, "hash": "0478fdea8ae96ca996a4fe2c57a03c80dee57c7e167c069e8c7779ac2738fedc", "text": "If Sani receives a Drishti from,  \nor is associated with a benefic, is placed in a Kendr, or in a Trikon, in Dhanu, or in Meen, there will be acquisition of a kingdom, conveyances and clothes. 61. Now I  \nam going to describe the effects of the Dasha of Budh, who is called a Kumar (in his teens) amongst all the Grahas. 62-65. If Budh is in his exaltation, in his own, in  \na friendly Rashi, or in Labh, Putr, or Dharm, there will be during his Dasha acquisition of wealth, gain of reputation, improvement in knowledge, benevolence of  \nGovernment, auspicious functions, happiness from wife and children, good health, availability of sweetish preparations, profits in business etc. If Budh receives a  \nDrishti from a benefic, is in Dharm, or is the Lord of Karm, the aforesaid beneficial results will be experienced in full and there will be great felicity all-round. 66-70. If  \nBudh is associated with a malefic, there will be during his Dasha punishment by Government, inimical relations with kinsmen, journey to a foreign country,  \ndependence on others and the possibility of urinary troubles. If Budh is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya, there will be loss of wealth, due to indulgence in lascivious  \nactivities, possibility of suffering from rheumatism and jaundice, danger of thefts and malevolence of Government, loss of land and cattle etc. At the commencement  \nof the Dasha of Budh, there will be gains of wealth, betterment in the educational sphere, birth of children and happiness. In the middle of the Dasha, there will be  \nrecognition from Government. The last part of the Dasha will be distressful. 71. Now I will tell you about the Dasha of Ketu, who is a headless trunk (Kabandha)  \namongst all the Grahas. 72-77. If Ketu is in a Kendr, a Trikon, or in Labh, in a benefic Rashi, in his exaltation, or in his own Rashi, there will be during his Dasha  \ncordial relations with the king, desired headship of a country, or village, comforts of conveyances, happiness from children, gain from foreign countries, happiness  \nfrom wife and acquisition of cattle. If Ketu is in Sahaj, Ari, or Labh, there will be in his Dasha acquisition of a kingdom, good relations with friends and opportunities  \nfor the acquisition of elephants. At the commencement of the Ketu Dasha there will be Raj Yog. During the middle portion of the Dasha there will be possibilities of  \nfearfulness and in the last part there will be sufferings from ailments and journeys to distant places. If Ketu is in Dhan, Randhr, or Vyaya, or receives a Drishti from  \na malefic, there will be imprisonment, destruction of kinsmen and residential premises and anxieties, company of menials and diseases. 78. Now I will describe the  \neffects of the Dasha of Sukr, who is the incarnate of intoxication, ecstasy, delight and pride amongst all the Grahas. 79-82. If Sukr is in his exaltation, in his own  \nRashi, or in a Kendr, or a Trikon, there will be during his Dasha acquisition of fancy clothes, ornaments, conveyances, cattle and land etc., availability of sweet  \npreparations every day, recognition from the sovereign, luxurious functions of songs and dances etc. by the benevolence of Goddess Lakshmi. If Sukr is in his  \nMultrikon, during his Dasha there will definitely be acquisition of a kingdom, acquisition of a house, birth of children and grandchildren, celebration of marriage in the  \nfamily, attainment of a high position, like the Commander of an Army, visits of friends, recovery of lost wealth, property, or kingdom. 83-84\u00bd.

If Sukr is in Bandhu, as Lord of Dharm, or Karm, there will be during his Dasha attainment of rulership of a country, or village, performance of pious  \ndeeds, like building of reservoirs and temples and giving grains etc. in charity, availability of sweet preparations every day, vigor in work, name and fame and  \nhappiness from wife and children. 88-89. Similar are the effects of Sukr in his sub-periods. If Sukr is Lord of Dhan, or Yuvati, there will be during his Dasha physical  \npains and troubles. To get alleviation from those troubles the native should perform Shatarudriya, or Mrityunjaya Japa in the prescribed manner and give in charity  \na cow, or female buffalo. \n \nCh. 48. Distinctive Effects of the Nakshatr Dasha, or of the Dashas of the Lords (Vimshottari) of various Bhavas \n \n1. If the Lord of Karm is placed in an auspicious Bhava in his exaltation Rashi etc., his Dasha effects will be favourable. The effects will be adverse, if the Lord of  \nKarm is in his debilitation Rashi and occupies an inauspicious Bhava. This proves, that an inauspicious Grah in his exaltation Rashi etc. will not produce  \nunfavourable results, if placed in an auspicious Bhava and a benefic, being in his debilitation Rashi and being placed in an inauspicious Bhava, will produce  \nadverse effects. Now I will describe the effects of the Dasha of the Lords of various Bhavas, who are related to each other. 2-4. There will be physical well-being in  \nthe Dasha of the Lord of Lagn, distress and possibility of death in the Dasha of the Lord of Dhan, unfavourable effects in the Dasha of the Lord of Sahaj, acquisition  \nof house and land in the Dasha of the Lord of Bandhu, progress in educational sphere and happiness from the children in the Dasha of the Lord of Putr and danger  \nfrom enemies and ill health in the Dasha of the Lord of Ari. 5-8. There will be distress to wife and the possibility of the death of the native in the Dasha of the Lord of  \nYuvati, the possibility of death and financial losses in the Dasha of the Lord of Randhr, improvement in the educational sphere, religious-mindedness and  \nunexpected gains of wealth in the Dasha of the Lord of Dharm, recognition from and awards by the Government in the Dasha of the Lord of Karm, obstacles in  \ngains of wealth and the possibility of diseases in the Dasha of the Lord of Labh and distress and danger from diseases in the Dasha of the Lord of Vyaya. A Grah,  \nplaced in an auspicious Bhava, like Trikon etc., at the commencement of the Dasha, produces favourable results in his Dasha. The Grah, placed in Ari, Randhr, or  \nVyaya at that time, yields only adverse results during his Dasha. It is therefore essential, that the placement of a Grah at the time of birth and at the commencement  \nof the Dasha should both be taken into account for the assessment of the Dasha effects. 14-17\u00bd. The Dasha of Ari\u2019s, Randhr\u2019s, or Vyaya\u2019s Lord also becomes  \nfavourable, if they get associated with the Lord of a Trikon. If the Lord of a Kendr is in a Trikon, or the Lord of a Trikon is in a Kendr, the Dasha of the Grah, yuti with  \neither of them, becomes favourable. The Dasha of a Grah, receiving a Drishti from the Lord of a Kendr, or Trikon is also favourable. If Dharm\u2019s Lord is in Lagn and  \nLagn\u2019s Lord is in Dharm, the Dashas of both of them will produce extremely beneficial results. There will be acquisition of a kingdom in the Dashas of Lagn\u2019s Lord  \nand Karm\u2019s Lord, if Karm\u2019s Lord is in Lagn and Lagn\u2019s Lord is in Karm. 18-20.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0a4b6ec-0076-4a86-81a1-cee1682b2c91": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0a4b6ec-0076-4a86-81a1-cee1682b2c91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0919995-67d3-4bd6-85ca-33ecbe7e57b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "146ed8fbf31ecfe214a408c28dbda671916bdc38ba2b65fae9b2f05ff1017530"}, "2": {"node_id": "301f5bf2-9bda-465d-a337-eeadb971688e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "a6743b68b01778c361462230665c1fd9e9be148af890a55eccd9083174e12e12"}}, "hash": "ed2e20e902b1b354387631d380209ccdab3eb700fa8676b2edac8b3cc9df2d78", "text": "18-20.

Effects of the Kaal Chakr \n \n1-5. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I am now going to describe to you the effects of the Kaal Chakr Dasha.

In the Dasha of Makar Navans  \nin Vrishabh there will be tendency to perform undesirable deeds along with more adverse effects. In the Kumbh Navans there will be profits in business, in the  \nMeen success in all ventures, in the Dasha of Vrischik Navans danger from fire, in the Dasha of Tula Navans recognition from Government and reverence from all,  \nin the Dasha of Kanya Navans danger from enemies, in the Dasha of Kark Navans distress to wife, in the Dasha of Simh Navans diseases of eyes and in the  \nDasha of Mithun Navans obstacles in earning livelihood.

Appropriate remedial measures (recitation of Mantras, oblations etc.) should be taken to alleviate the adverse effects, caused  \nby malefic Dashas. 35-37. The effects of Dasha in Raj Yog etc. have already been described in Vol. I of this book. The same should be applied in a judicious  \nmanner in the Kaal Chakr. These are in brief effects of Kaal Chakr Dasha. \n \nCh. 50. Effects of the Char etc. Dashas \n \n1-3. Maharishi Parashar said. O Brahmin! I have already described the Char etc. Dashas. Now I am going to tell you the effects of these Dashas. The effects of the  \nDashas of the Rashis should be judged from the strength of the Lords of Rashis and whether they are benefics, or malefics.

If the Lord of  \nRashi possesses little strength, the effects will be experienced accordingly. 4-10. If there are malefics in the 8th, the 5th and the 9th from a Dasha Rashi, the effects  \nof the Dasha of that Rashi will be distressful. If there are malefics in the 3rd and the 6th from a Dasha Rashi, the effects of the Dasha will be victory over enemies  \nand happiness. If there are benefics in the 3rd and the 6th from the Dasha Rashi, there will be defeat in its Dasha. If there are benefics, or malefics in the 11th from  \nthe Dasha Rashi, there will be conquests and happiness in the Dasha. If the Dasha Rashi is occupied by, or is owned by a benefic, the effects of its Dasha will be  \nbeneficial. If a Dasha Rashi, owned by a benefic, is occupied by a malefic, favourable effects will be experienced in the first part of the Dasha and they will be  \nadverse in the latter part. If a Dasha Rashi, owned by a malefic is occupied by a benefic, the effects of the Dasha will be the same. A Dasha Rashi, owned and  \noccupied by a malefic will always yield unfavourable results. The reverse will be the case in the case of the Dasha Rashi, owned and occupied by a benefic. If a  \nDasha Rashi, owned by a benefic, is occupied by both benefic and malefic Grahas, the effects of Dasha will be adverse in its first part and favourable in the latter  \npart. 11-17. The assessment of the effects of the Dasha of the Dasha Rashi should be made after taking into account the disposition of the Grahas in the Rashi at  \nbirth and the disposition of Grahas during the Dasha. If the Dasha Rashi is well disposed both at the time of birth and during its Dasha, the beneficial results will be  \nrealized in full. If it is ill-disposed during the Dasha, the effects will be of mixed nature. If the Dasha Rashi is ill-disposed both at the time of birth and during its  \nDasha, only evil effects will be experienced. 18-19. The effects of the Dasha will be favourable, if it is occupied by a benefic and there is also a benefic in the Rashi  \nprevious to it. If the Rashi is occupied by a malefic, the effects will be of adverse nature. If there are benefics in Putr and Dharm, the effects of its Dasha will be  \nfavourable. The reverse will be the case, if Putr and Dharm are occupied by malefics. 20-21. Kumbh, Vrishabh, Simh and Vrischik are Badhak Bhavas for the four  \nMovable Rashis: Mesh, Kark, Tula and Makar. In other words the 11th Rashi to a Movable Rashi is its Badhak Bhava. If there is a malefic in the Bhava, occupied  \nby its Lord, or in Badhak Bhava of that Rashi, there will be occasions of great sorrow, imprisonment and diseases during the Dasha. 22. The Dasha of a Rashi will  \nbe favourable, if it is occupied by its own Lord, or an exalted Grah. The Dasha of a Rashi, not occupied by any Grah, will be adverse. 23-25. There will be great  \ndanger, imprisonment during a journey, displeasure of Government and danger from enemies in the Dasha and Antar Dasha of the Rashi, from which its Badhak  \nBhava, Vyaya, Ari and Randhr are occupied by Rahu. There will be loss, due to the displeasure of the king and danger therefrom in the Antar Dasha of the Rashi,  \nthat is occupied by Surya, Mangal, Rahu and Sani. There will be the possibility of death, if the 5th and the 9th from the Antar Dasha Rashi are occupied by a  \ndebilitated, or malefic Grah. 26-28.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fb205ac-7a92-473b-bbfc-1d3f55f4c358": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fb205ac-7a92-473b-bbfc-1d3f55f4c358", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b52df93-d4a9-4d5d-85bf-67a68fa6eba1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "916f9847d2eda5a8b4cce186f2aacec058e19b7712a796a8ba5af308d0e32f1b"}, "2": {"node_id": "6935c461-7ad5-491e-8e62-a87ea725900f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "f296d4a2c41a0aa57ae36099639908dd8cd6428c6892d20ad478a8d082a3cde3"}}, "hash": "e63368d82f18049c8f8a7292ec1f7ce438203ae25116462f08c7dc72f4bdf267", "text": "26-28.

The Dashas of that Grah will be favourable, who is Raj Yog Karak, who is disposed between two benefics (that is there are  \nbenefics in the 2nd and the 12th Bhavas to that Grah) and who has benefics in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Bhavas from him. A malefic Grah becomes favourable, if he is  \ndisposed between benefics. 35-36. The whole of the Dasha of a Grah, who is related to a friendly and benefic Grah at the commencement and the end of the  \nDasha, will be favourable. In an unfavourable Dasha the Antar Dasha of a benefic (Grah, or Rashi) becomes favourable. The Dasha of a Grah, or Rashi, who has  \nbenefics in the 5th, or the 9th from it, is also favourable. In this manner the effects of the Dasha should be judged, after taking into account the dispositions of the  \nGrah, or Rashi at the commencement and at the end of the Dasha. 37-39. The Dasha of the Grahas and Rashis, who have benefics in the Trikon from them is  \nfavourable. If the Dasha of a benefic Rashi commences in a benefic Rashi, it will be very favourable. If an evil Dasha commences in a benefic Rashi, it is also  \nfavourable. Therefore the commencement of a Dasha should always be kept in view in assessing the results of the Dasha. There will be loss of fortune, if at the  \ncommencement of the Dasha there is a malefic Rashi, or, if the Lord of the Dasha Rashi is in debilitation. 40-41. There will be loss of fortune, wealth and  \nagricultural products and infliction with disease during the Dasha of the Rashi, occupied by a debilitated Grah, or, if there is a debilitated Grah in the 5th from it, or in  \nthe 9th from it, or whose Lord is debilitated, or related to a debilitated Grah. 42. Four Rashis from Kumbh and four Rashis from Vrischik belong to Rahu and Ketu,  \nrespectively. If Rahu and Ketu are in any one of the aforesaid Rashis, the Dasha will be productive of beneficial results. 43-45. If a Grah, whose Dasha is otherwise  \nconsidered favourable, is placed in a Marak Bhava, or, if the Rashi, in which his Dasha comes to an end, receives a Drishti from Sukr, or Candr, there will be in his  \nDasha displeasure of government and loss of wealth. 46-47. There will be loss of everything, imprisonment, death, exile from the country and great distress at the  \nend of the Dasha of Rahu. The above effects will definitely be realized, if there are malefics in the 5th and the 9th from Rahu. Beneficial and adverse effects should  \nbe predicted in this manner. 48-50. The same would be the effects in the Dasha of the Rashi, occupied by malefics, like Rahu etc. The association of a Marak Grah  \nwith the Rashi at the time of commencement of its Dasha is not productive of good effects. If such a Grah is Rahu, there will be imprisonment, or loss of wealth. 51-\n52. The natural characteristics of the Bhava, occupied by Rahu, are harmed at the commencement of the Dasha. If such a Bhava is Dhan, there will be loss of  \nwealth. If Candr and Sukr are in Vyaya, there will be losses, due to the displeasure of government. If Mangal and Ketu are so disposed, there will be death, or  \ndanger from fire. There will be acquisition of a kingdom, if Sukr and Candr are in Dhan at the commencement of the Dasha. This means, that the effects of the  \nBhava, in which Candr and Sukr are placed at the commencement and end of a Dasha, are strengthened.

If the Grah, causing uninterrupted Argal,  \ngives a Drishti to a Rashi, that Rashi will prevail. In other words good effects will be derived in the Dasha of that Rashi. The Dasha of the Rashi, which does not  \nreceive a Drishti from an auspicious Argal, or the Dasha of a Rashi with Vipreet Argal will not be favourable. The Dasha of that Rashi, which receives a Drishti from  \na benefic, will be favourable. 56-59. Financial gains will be derived in the Dasha of the Rashi, which is occupied by its benefic Lord, or by an exalted Grah, who  \nreceives a Drishti from him. There will be loss of wealth, if such a Grah is in the 12th Bhava to the Rashi (or Bhava). There will be destruction of all good effects,  \ndistress to children and father and mental agony in the Dasha of the Rashi, if there are malefics in the 5th and the 9th from the Rashi.

The Dasha of the Rashi will cause  \ndistress to children, exile to a foreign country and continuous disturbances in life, if Rahu and Ketu are in the Trikon to the Rashi. There will be danger from  \nenemies, from the king and disease in the Dasha of the Rashi, which is so posited, that the 6th and the 8th from it are occupied by malefic, debilitated, or combust  \nGrahas. There will be destruction of house, land and agricultural fields, if there is a malefic, or debilitated Grah in the 4th from the Rashi. There will be loss of  \nhouse, due to negligence, if such a Grah is Mangal. There will be heart pain and danger from government, if the Grah is Sani and there will be losses all round and  \ndanger from poison and thieves, if the Grah is Rahu. 64-66\u00bd. There will be pilgrimage to holy places in the Dasha of the Rashi, who has Rahu in the 10th to it.  \nThere will be gain of earnings, religious rites, gain of wealth, renown for good deeds and success in efforts and ventures in the Dasha of the Rashi, which is so  \nposited, that the 10th, the 11th and the 9th from it are occupied by benefics. There will be birth of children, happiness from wife and recognition by the Government  \nin the Dasha of the Rashi, from which the 5th, the 7th and the 9th are occupied by benefic, or exalted Grahas.

The good effects will be in proportion to the strength of the  \nBhavas and the Grahas, occupying them. 67-70. In the Dasha of a Rashi (Bhava) there will be well-being, increase in opulence and glory and devotion to deities  \nand Brahmins, if it is occupied by Guru, Sukr, or the Lord of a Trikon. There will be acquisition of more conveyances and cattle etc. in the Dasha of the Rashi  \n(Bhava), which is so posited, that the 4th from it is occupied by an exalted Grah, or Lord of a Trikon.

The Dasha of a Grah in deep debilitation is called Rikt. Diseases, loss of wealth and danger of death are the effects of the Dasha of such a Grah. The  \nDasha of the Grah, who is in a condition in between deep exaltation and deep debilitation is known, as Avrohini (descending). The Dasha of the Grah in exaltation,  \nor in a friend\u2019s Rashi is called Madhya (of middle order). This Dasha also yields moderately good effects. The Dasha of a Grah, placed in a condition in between  \ndeep debilitation and deep exaltation, is called Rohini (ascending). The Dasha of a Grah, placed in between the debilitated and enemy Navans is called Adham  \n(evil). Dangers of various kinds, distress and sorrows are the results of the Dasha of such a Grah. These Dashas give results, according to their nomenclature. 84-\n87. The Dashas of other Grahas become auspicious and augment the fortune, if the Lord of Dharm and Guru are in any way related with Yog, Kendr, or the Bhava  \nconcerned etc. The Grah with Yog of good fortune at birth produces good effects, when he is free from retrogression and becomes direct. The weakness, inabilities  \nand Yogas of other Grahas should also be taken into account in judging their effects. All those Dashas give full, medium and little effects in accordance with the  \ndisposition of the Grahas in the Kendr, Panaphara and Apoklima. 88-89\u00bd. The Grahas in Shirshodaya, Ubhayodaya and Prishthodaya Rashis, yield their results,  \nrespectively, at the commencement, in the middle and at the end of the Dasha.

There will be gains, or losses of Dhatus etc., assigned to the Rashis and the Grahas, in the Antar Dasha of the Rashis  \nconcerned. In judging the effects of the Antar Dashas of the Grahas their benefic and malefic nature, relations with the malefic, or benefic, Drishtis on them and  \ntheir disposition in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya etc. should all be kept in view. 97. The results of the Antar Dasha\u2019s Pratyantar Dashas of the Rashis should be assessed  \nin the manner, explained in this chapter. \n \nCh. 51.

For finding out the span of the Antar Dasha of a Grah in the Dasha of the same, or another Grah multiply the Dasha years of the former with the Dasha years of  \nthe latter and divide the product by the total Dasha years of all the Grahas. For finding out the span of the Pratyantar Dasha of the same, or any other Grah in the  \nAntar Dasha of another Grah multiply the years etc. of the Antar Dasha with the Dasha years of the other Grah and divide the product by the total Dasha years of  \nall the Grahas. The figure so available in months etc. will represent the Pratyantar Dasha of the former. 2. In every Dasha the first Antar Dasha belongs to the Lord  \nof the Dasha. Then the further Antar Dashas belong to the other 8 Grahas in the same order, as followed for the Dashas. The same applies to Pratyantar Dasha.  \nThe Antar Dashas of Char Grahas in Char etc. Dasha 3-4. The Antar Dashas of the Charadi Kendradi Dasha of the Grahas are worked out by dividing the Dasha  \nyears by 9. The first Dasha will invariably be of the Lord of the Dasha. Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas of Grahas, placed in Kendras, Panapharas and  \nApoklimas, respectively, according to their strength. Antar Dashas of Rashis 5. The Antar Dashas of Rashis is worked out by dividing the Dasha years by 12.  \nPratyantar Dashas of the Antar Dashas are also calculated in the same manner. 6. The Antar Dashas will start from the Dasha Rashi, or from the Rashi 7th  \ntherefrom, whichever is stronger. The Antar Dashas are in the onwards order, if the Dasha Rashi is odd and in the reverse order, if it is even. 7-12. O Brahmin! Now  \nI will acquaint you with the special characteristics of the order of the Antar Dashas of the Rashis. If the Dasha Rashi is a Movable one, the Antar Dashas of the 12  \nRashis are in the onwards, or reverse order. If the Dasha Asraya Rashi is a Fixed one, the Antar Dashas will start from it and thereafter there will be an Antar  \nDasha of every sixth Rashi. If the Dasha Ashraya Rashi is a Dual one, the first Antar Dasha will belong to it. Thereafter there will be Antar Dashas of Rashis in  \nKendr to it, Rashis in Kendr to the 5th from it and Rashis in Kendr to the 9th from it. In the case of all kinds of Rashis, namely Movable, Fixed, or Dual, the order will  \nbe onwards, if the Dasha Asraya Rashi is an odd one and in the reverse order, if it is an even one. The so called Dasha Asraya Rashi is known, as Pak Rashi. In  \nthe first order Rashi, which is Pak Rashi, is also called Bhog Rashi. Later, if the Dasha Prad Rashi is even, then the Bhog Rashi will be that, which is at the same  \nRashi distance, as the Dasha Asraya Rashi is from the Dasha Prad Rashi. For the Char, Sthir and Trikon Dasha, the Pak and Bhog should be determined in this  \nmanner. If Pak and Bhog Rashis are associated with malefics, there will be pain in the body and mental agony. There will be enjoyment, if they are associated with  \nbenefics. In the Kaal Chakr Dasha, like the Vimshottari Dasha system, the span of Dasha should be multiplied by the span of the Dasha of the Rashi, whose Antar  \nDasha is required and the product should be divided by the total Dasha years of (all) the Rashi(s). The years, months etc. as arrived at will represent the Antar  \nDasha of the Rashi concerned. 13-16.

The effects of Antar Dashas in the Kala Chakr,  \nwhich have been described above, are based on Savya Chakr. The effects of Antar Dashas in the Dashas of the Rashis in the Apsavya Chakr have to be  \nassessed, after taking into account the benefic and malefic natures of the Lords of the Rashis. People have to enjoy the good, or suffer the bad results, according to  \ntheir good, or bad actions in the previous births. Everybody suffers, or enjoys accordingly. The peculiarity in this respect is, that inauspicious results have been  \nascribed to malefics. But, if during the Antar Dasha the Grah concerned is a friend of the Lord of the Dasha, the results of the Antar Dasha will be favourable. If the  \nGrah concerned is a benefic, but an enemy of the Lord of the Dasha, his Antar Dasha effects will not prove favourable. This is how the Antar Dasha effects have to  \nbe analyzed and conclusions arrived at. \n \nCh. 65. Effects of Dashas of Rashis in the Ansas of the Various Rashis \n \n1-3.

The sage replied: \u201cO Brahmin! You have put a very intelligent question. I will now describe the Shastra for the benefit of all, the Shastra, in which  \nthere will be no contradictions in judging the effects of happiness and sorrows and for determination of the longevity. You now listen to me carefully. 7-11. If the 12  \nBhavas, including Lagn, are occupied by, or aspected by benefic Grahas, they yield auspicious results, according to their characteristics, but this happens, where  \nthe Grahas concerned are in their exaltation Rashi, own Rashi, or posited in a benefic Bhava. There will be no good effects, if such Grahas are in depression, or  \nposited in an inauspicious Bhava. Similarly the Bhavas, associated with, or aspected by malefics in depression, or posited in malefic Bhavas, yield adverse results,  \naccording to their characteristics. If such Grahas be in their exaltation Rashi, the effects will not be adverse. This is how the general effects have been described by  \nthe Daivajnas. I have only repeated those effects. The main purposes of this Jyotish Shastra are to determine the longevity and joys and sorrows of the people, but  \nbecause the movements of the Grahas are so subtle, even sages, like Vashista and Brihaspati, have not been able to be quite definite in this respect. Then how  \ncan a common man, particularly in Kaliyuga, do so. 12. There are two divisions, or parts of the Jyotish Shastra, namely general and particular. I have already dealt  \nwith the general part. I now come to the other part, which deals with this subject in particular. 13-15. As the effects of the twelve Bhavas are judged from Lagn and  \nCandr, effects of the twelve Bhavas and the various Grahas are judged in the same manner. Therefore the inauspicious places from the seven Grahas, named, as  \nKaran, beginning from Surya and Lagn (total 8), should be marked by dots (Bindus) and auspicious places, named, as Sthan, by small vertical lines (Rekhas) and  \non the basis of their assessment should the judgment of the horoscope and predictions be made.\u201d Notes. The above arrangement is known, as AshtakaVarg. The  \nmeaning of AshtakaVarg is literally the group of eight things. In other words it is the combination of the good and bad positions of a Grah with reference to the  \nseven Grahas and Lagn.

Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVarg \n \n1-5. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is done after writing the numbers for Rashis, arrived at by Trikon Shodhana. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is done, if both the two Rashis,  \nowned by a Grah, have gained a number after Trikon Shodhana. Ekadhipatya Shodhana is not to be done, if one Rashi has got a number and the other is bereft of  \nany number. The following are the rules for Ekadhipatya Shodhana. If both the Rashis are without a Grah and the Trikon Shodhana numbers are different, both  \nshould be given the smaller number. If both the Rashis are with Grahas, no Shodhana is to be done. If amongst the two Rashis one is with a Grah and a smaller  \nTrikon rectified number and the other is without Grah with a bigger number, deduct the smaller number from the bigger number and the number of the Rashi with  \nGrah should be kept unchanged. If the Rashi with the Grah has a bigger number than that of the Rashi without Grah, the Shodhana should be done of the number  \nof the Rashi without Grah and the number of the Rashi with Grah should be kept unchanged. If both the Rashis are without Grahas and possess the same  \nnumbers, Shodhana of both the numbers should be done and the rectified numbers should be reduced to zero. If one Rashi is with Grah and the other is without  \nany Grah, the number of the latter should be reduced to zero. Surya and Candr own one Rashi only, their numbers should be kept unchanged. 6.

After completing the Trikon and Ekadhipatya Shodhana in the AshtakaVargas of all the Grahas, the rectified number should be  \nmultiplied by the measure of the Rashi. If there be any Grah in any Rashi, the rectified number should be multiplied by the measure of the Grah also. Then, after  \nmultiplying the rectified number of each Rashi, the products should be added up. The total so arrived at will be Pinda of that Grah.

Surya - the soul (Atma), nature, physical strength, joys and sorrows and father.  \nCandr - mind, wisdom, joy and mother. Mangal - co-borns, strength, qualities and land. Budh - business dealings, livelihood and friends. Guru - nourishment of the  \nbody, learning, son (children), wealth and property. Sukr - marriage, enjoyments, conveyance, prostitution and sexual intercourse with women. Sani - longevity,  \nsource of maintenance, grief, danger, losses and death. The following procedure should be adopted to ascertain the effects of a house. Multiply the number of  \nRekhas with the Yog Pinda (Rashi Pinda plus Grah Pinda), connected with the AshtakaVarg of that Grah and divide the product by 27. The remainder will denote  \nthe number of the Nakshatr. During the transit of Sani in that Nakshatr the Bhava concerned will be harmed. 7-9. The 9th house from Surya at the time of birth  \ndeals with father. The Rekhas of that Rashi, as marked in Surya\u2019s AshtakaVarg, should be multiplied by the Yog Pinda and the product be divided by 27. The  \nremainder will denote the number of Nakshatr. The father will be in distress, or he will otherwise suffer, when Sani in transit passes through the Nakshatr. Even,  \nwhen Sani passes in transit the Trikon Nakshatras, father, or relatives, like father, may die, or suffer. Notes. By dividing the 27 Nakshatras in three equal parts, the  \n1st, 10th and 19th fall in Trikon from each other. Surya is PitraKarak (significator of father). Therefore all about father is ascertained from the Surya\u2019s AshtakaVarg.  \n10-11. If the AshtakaVarg Rekha number is multiplied by the Yog Pinda and the product is divided by 12, the remainder will denote the Rashi, through which, or  \nthrough the Rashis in Trikon to it, the transit of Sani will cause harm, or unfavourable effects to father. Death of the father may occur, if the Dasa prevailing at that  \ntime be unfavourable. If the Dasa be favourable, father will face only adverse effects. (12-15 Arishta to Father) 12-14. The death of the father may be expected, if  \nRahu, Sani, or Mangal are in the 4th from Surya at the time of transit of Sani through any of the above three Rashis (Trikon Rashis). The death of the father will  \ncome to pass by such transit, if at that time Sani, associated, or aspected by a malefic, be in the 9th from Lagn, or Candr and/or the Dasa of the Lord of the 4th  \nfrom Lagn be in operation. The death does not take place, if a favourable Dasa be in force at the time of Sani\u2019s transit. This should be kept in mind by the Jyotishis,  \nwhile making predictions. 15. If the Rashi of Lagn of the native be the 8th Rashi from Lagn of the father, or, if the Lord of the 8th from father\u2019s Lagn be in Lagn of  \nthe native, he takes over all the responsibilities of his father after the latter\u2019s death. 16-18.

If Mangal be weak, the brothers will be short lived. There will be distress to brothers, when  \nMangal transits a Rashi without Rekhas. Here also the Yog Pinda of Mangal should be multiplied by the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg and the product be  \ndivided separately by 27 and 12. The remainders will denote the Nakshatr and Rashi. The brother will suffer, whenever Sani transits that Nakshatr, or Rashi (or the  \nTrikon Nakshatras, or Rashis). 28-29. Consideration in regard to family, maternal uncle and friends should be done from the 4th Bhava from Budh. The family etc.  \nwill enjoy happiness during the transit of Budh\u2019s AshtakaVarg. After performing Trikon and Ekadhipatya Shodhana in Budh\u2019s AshtakaVarg, the happiness, or  \ndistress of the family should be predicted from the transit of Sani through the resultant Nakshatr and Rashi (and those in Trikon to them). 30-33. All about  \nknowledge, religious inclinations of the native and son (progeny) is to be ascertained from the 5th Bhava from Guru. If the Rekhas in the 5th Bhava from Guru are  \nlarger in number in the AshtakaVarg, there will be great happiness in respect of progeny. If the dots are larger in number, the happiness in respect of progeny will  \nbe meagre. The number of children are equal to the number of Rekhas in the 5th Bhava (from Guru), provided it is not the Rashi of debilitation of Guru, or his  \nenemy\u2019s Rashi. In that case the number of children will be very limited. The number of children is also equal to the number of Navams, in which the Lord of the 5th  \nfrom Guru is posited. Multiply the Yog Pinda of Guru by the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg and divide the product separately by 27 and 12. The remainders  \nwill denote the Nakshatr and Rashi. Transit of Sani through that Nakshatr and its Trikon Nakshatras and of that Rashi and its Trikon Rashis will be inauspitious.  \nDuring that period the knowledge, learning and religious activities of the native will also be adversely affected. 34-36.

Therefore predict distress to the native in the year, equal to the number of Rekhas in the AshtakaVarg from Lagn  \nup to Sani. The year, equal to the number of Rekhas from Sani up to Lagn, will also be of distress.

I will now describe the method of determining longevity from the AshtakaVarg. For this purpose the AshtakaVargas of Lagn and all the Grahas  \nhave to be studied. The Rekhas in all the Rashis have been allotted specific spans of life. The Rashi, which has no Rekhas, has been allotted 2 days, that with one  \nRekha gets l\u00bd days, one day for Rashi with 2 Rekhas, half day for Rashi with 3 Rekhas, 7\u00bd days for Rashi with 4 Rekhas, 2 years for Rashi with 5 Rekhas, 4 years  \nfor Rashi with 6 Rekhas, 6 years for Rashi with 7 Rekhas and 8 years for Rashi with 8 Rekhas. In this manner the spans of life should be worked from Rekhas in all  \nthe AshtakaVargas. Half of the sum total of all will be the longevity, based on AshtakaVarg. \n \nCh. 72. Aggregational AshtakaVargas \n \n1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Write down a Rashi Kundali with 12 Bhavas, including Lagn. Then insert the total of the Rekhas in all the AshtakaVargas of the  \nGrahas in the Rashi concerned. The AshtakaVarg with such Rekhas is called the Samuday AshtakaVarg, or the aggregational AshtakaVarg. From this should be  \njudged good and adverse effects of the Rashi Kundali. 3-5. In the aggregational AshtakaVarg the Rashi, which has more than 30 Rekhas, gives favourable effects,  \nthat, having between 25 and 30 Rekhas, produces medium effects and that Rashi, who has less than 25 Rekhas, yields adverse effects. Auspicious functions, like  \nmarriage etc., should be performed, when the Grah, on whose basis the time and date of functions are performed, moves into the Rashi with favourable effects.  \nThe Rashi, which is productive of adverse effects should be avoided for these purposes.

Effects of the Rays of the Grahas \n \n1-2. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to tell you about the number of rays of the Grahas. When Surya etc. are in their deep exaltation point, their rays  \nare: Surya 10, Candr 9, Mangal 5, Budh 5, Guru 7, Sukr 8 and Sani 5. The rays are nil, when these Grahas are in deep debilitation, the number of rays would be  \nproportionate with the number of Rashi. The following method is to be adopted for ascertaining the proportionate number of rays. Deduct the debilitation Rashi etc.  \nof the Grah, whose rays are to be ascertained, from his longitude. If the remainder is less than 6 Rashis it should be multiplied by the number of rays of that Grah,  \nmentioned above and the product should be divided by 6. The result will denote the number of rays of that Grah. In case after deduction the remainder is more than  \n6 Rashis, then it should be deducted from 12. The other procedure will remain the same. 3-7. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Other Acharyas have recommended  \nfurther correction of the number of rays, worked out in the manner described above. The corrections have to be made, as follows. If the Grah be in his exaltation  \nRashi, the number of rays ascertained should be trebled. \u2026 Mooltrikon, \u2026 doubled. \u2026 own Rashi, \u2026 multiplied by 3 and the product be divided by 2. \u2026 Rashi of  \nhis Adhimitr (great friend), \u2026 multiplied by 4 and the product be divided by 3. \u2026 Bhava of a friend, \u2026 multiplied by 6 and the product be divided by 5. The number  \nof rays ascertained should be halved, if the Grah be in the Bhava of his enemy. If he be in the Bhava of his Adhi-Shatru (great enemy), the number of rays  \nascertained should be multiplied by 2 and the product be divided by 5. No correction is to be made, if the Grah is in the Bhava of a neutral. The effects should be  \ndeclared after computation of the net number of rays of each Grah. 8-18. The effects, produced by the number of rays of Grahas, are given below. Between 1 and 5  \npoor and unhappy, even if born in an eminent family. Between 6 and 10 poor, carrier of loads and without wife and children. 11 meagre wealth and few children. 12  \nmeagre wealth, idiot and wicked. 13 thief. 14 wealthy, protector and maintainer of several families, learned and observer of the traditions of the family. 15 head of  \nthe family, achieves proficiency in many kinds of learnings, good qualities.

Auspicious and inauspicious effects of all the Grahas are according to the number of rays they possess. The prediction will not be correct  \nwithout the knowledge of the effects of the rays. Therefore it is imperative, that in the judgment of Rashi Kundalis and declaring results the effects of the number of  \nrays of the Grahas be taken into account. \n \nCh. 74. Effects of the Sudarshana Chakr \n \n1-3. Maharishi Parasara said to Maitreya. O Brahmin! Now I will impart to you the knowledge of a great secrecy and superior importance, which was communicated  \nto me by Lord Brahma himself for the benefit of the world. This is a Chakr by the name of Sudarshana, through which Devajnas will be able to predict the  \nfavourable and unfavourable results for every year, every month and every day from the time of birth to the time of death of a person. Listen to this very intently. 4.  \nO Brahmin! Take a point and from it draw three circles. Within the circles draw 12 lines, so as to provide 12 Bhavas within each circle. This is how Sudarshana  \nChakr is drawn. 5-6. In the first circle (innermost) place the 12 Bhavas from Lagn with Grahas, posited there. In the circle next to the innermost circle place the 12  \nBhavas from the Rashi of Candr with the Grahas in them. In the third circle place the 12 Bhavas from the Rashi of Surya with Grahas in them. Thus there will be 3  \nRashis in each Bhava of the Chakr. 7-9. The significant aspect of this Chakr is, that Lagn, Candr and Surya represent the first Bhava. The 2nd, 3rd etc. up to 12th  \nfrom Candr and Surya will deal with the same subject, as they do, when reckoned from Lagn. Then the results should be assessed, according to the Grahas in  \neach Bhava. In this form of Rashi Kundali Surya is considered auspicious in the first Bhava and inauspicious, or malefic in other Bhavas. The malefics do not  \nproduce evil effects, if they are in their exaltation Rashi. In this manner predictions should be made, after considering the benefic and malefic natures of the Grahas,  \ntheir disposition and aspects from and on them. 10. A Bhava gets advancement, if it is occupied, or aspected by the Lord, or a benefic. The Bhava, which is  \noccupied, or aspected by a malefic, is harmed. 11-13. The effects of a Bhava will be in accordance with the Grah occupying it, or in accordance with the Grah  \naspected, if no Grah is in occupation of the Bhava. The effects of a Bhava, occupied by a benefic, will be auspicious and the Bhava, occupied by a malefic, will be  \ninauspicious. Effects of the aspects will be the same. If a Bhava is influenced both by benefics and malefics, the results will depend on the majority amongst the  \nbenefics and malefics. If the number of benefics is larger than the number of malefics, the results will be auspicious.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8af690a-f358-49fe-95cf-c99501f4740d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8af690a-f358-49fe-95cf-c99501f4740d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6fc1c41-9f22-4379-b834-0a4aab549388", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "062d6dbb728d38c8bdc50bbbd44800864a1869d08fa7f542f7c380b19ad39be3"}, "2": {"node_id": "96d8d133-1430-408d-b92b-8bf21f21e3f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "42de864b6ca5d53d007813d043a00899638f70db2c9b54437bd5e486b1134eb6"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f5f22e6-dabc-45ec-ae77-c6bea881f6b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6705d4018aba78ef497455ac2bd15bed7e386ab518e49d1c4a57a88ef9c6d65a"}}, "hash": "64df6f77e7d1d1f0c9b88877e8c8076d402fe2f370a4779ff88f69d2638848f1", "text": "If reverse is the case, inauspicious, or evil  \neffects may be expected.

The effects should be declared,  \naccording to its Lord, if the Bhava is neither occupied, nor aspected by a Grah. 15-16. A natural benefic loses his benevolence, if he is in more malefic Vargas.  \nSimilarly a natural malefic loses his malevolence, if he is in more benefic Vargas (SaptaVarg). A Grah\u2019s own Rashi, his exaltation Rashi and benefic Vargas are  \nconsidered auspicious. And malefic and the Vargas of an enemy and debilitated Rashi are considered inauspicious. 17. The sage said, that the results should be  \ndeclared only after assessing the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of all the Bhavas. 18. Maitreya asked. O Venerable sage! Kindly enlighten me on one point.  \nIf all the Bhavas are judged in accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, why many learned sages have advocated declaration of effects from the Bhavas, reckoned  \nfrom Lagn in Rashi Kundali? 19-20. The sage replied. The results should be declared in accordance with the Sudarshana Chakr, only when Surya and Candr being  \nin separate Rashis different from the Rashi of Lagn. If amongst Lagn, Surya and Candr, all the three, or two of them are in the same Rashi, the judgment of effects  \nshould be made from the Rashi Kundali only. (21-23) The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about the effects, produced every year and every month by the  \ntwelve Bhavas in their Dasas and Antardasas, according to Sudarshana Chakr. Under this system every one of the twelve Bhavas, beginning from the 1st, is  \nallotted a Dasa period of one year. Thus every year in 12 years a Bhava becomes Lagn of the year and the remaining become 2nd, 3rd and so on. Every year  \nevery Bhava will have Antardasa of one month. By following the method of Lagn of the year here also, there will be a Lagn of the month. The first Antardasa will be  \nof the first Bhava and then will follow for 12 months the Antardasas of the other Bhavas, every Bhava assuming the role of Lagn by turn. Every Bhava gets  \nPratyantar Dasa of 2\u00bd days and Vidasa of 12\u00bd Ghatikas. The same method is to be adopted for judging the effects of Bhavas in Pratyantar Dasas and Vidasas.  \n24-26. At the time of commencement of a Dasa, if there be benefic in the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, 5th, 9th and 8th, favourable effects will be experienced in the  \nconcerned year, month etc. The Bhava, which is occupied by only Rahu, or Ketu, becomes harmful. The same will be the fate of the Bhava, which is occupied by a  \nlarger number of malefics. If there be benefics in Bhavas other than the 12th, or 6th, the Bhava concerned will produce favourable effects.

He rules happily over several parts of the earth and then leaves for his  \nheavenly abode at the age of 70. \n \nCh. 76. Effects of the Elements \n \n1. The sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you about the effects of the five elements: space, air, fire, water and earth. 2. Space, air, fire, water and earth are ruled  \nby Guru, Sani, Mangal, Sukr and Budh. The effects are experienced in proportion to the intensity of the various elements. 3-4. The native will have temperament,  \naccording to the greater strength of the Grah at the time of birth. Guru, Sani, Mangal, Sukr and Budh will, respectively, give spacial (etheral), airy (windy), fiery,  \nwatery and earthy temperament. If all of them, or many of these Grahas have equal strength, the temperament will be of a mixed character. 5. If Surya be endowed  \nwith strength, the native will have fiery temperament. If Candr be strong, the native will have watery temperament. All the Grahas in course of their Dasa endow the  \nnative with bodily lustre, relating to their elements. 6. The characteristic features of the person with fiery temperament are: distressed with hunger, restless, lean  \nand thin body, learned, consumes a large quantity of food, sharp, fair-complexioned and proud. 7. \u2026 earthy: emits fragrance of camphor and lotus, is fond of  \nluxuries, comforts and enjoyments and is permanently happy, forgiving and has a deep voice, like a lion. 8. \u2026 etheral: acquainted with semasiology, expert in  \ndiplomacy, brilliant, learned, unmasked face and long stature. 9. \u2026 watery: is lustrous, can sustain burdens, is soft-spoken, king, has many friends and is learned.  \n10. \u2026 airy: charitable, full of anger, fair complexion, fond of wandering, victorious over enemies, king and has lean physique. 11. When the fire element is  \npredominant in a person, his face and body exhibit lustre, like gold and he has happy-looking eyes. He achieves success in all his ventures, is victorious over his  \nenemies and gets gains of wealth. 12. \u2026 earth, the body of the person emits various kinds of fragrances. His nails, hair and teeth are are clean. He gets gains of  \nhappiness and wealth and is religious-minded. 13. \u2026 ether, the person is a clever conversationalist and becomes happy by learning to songs etc. 14. \u2026 water, the  \nperson\u2019s body is slender, he enjoys good health and tasty food and is happy on that account. 15. \u2026 air, the body is filthy. The person becomes an idiot and suffers  \nfrom rheumatism, sorrows and agonies. 16. The sage said. O Brahmin! The effects of the elements, which I have described above, will be realized in full, if the  \nGrahas concerned are endowed with adequate strength. If they are weak, the effects will be reduced in proportion to their weakness. 17. If the Grah concerned is in  \nhis debilitation Rashi, or be placed in an inauspicious Bhava, the elemental effects will be adverse, that is, opposite to the effects, described above. If a Grah is  \nwithout strength, his elemental effects will be experienced only in imagination. 18.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed393f68-ce87-4385-ac02-31a1defe779e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed393f68-ce87-4385-ac02-31a1defe779e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d784aa9-9137-4699-9d3e-cbebcfe7218f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b121485409f305bd08ddcb7226557956644d1385027dc82412416b9e888e9d85"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c3b71dc-5d53-439b-824c-edcc5c411796", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "ca9660dc805cf7f84ee803244f15bf2996bdd711d2ad8240c8ea8aba420fdf94"}}, "hash": "1db73bda2708eff03c4642a98d4c6ef39810e0722a2f1188a789e7aabef0c6fb", "text": "18.

Effects of the Gunas \n \n1-4. The Great Sage Parasara said. O Brahmin! When the Sattva-Guni Grahas are predominant, the person born is Sattva-Guni and of good character. When Rajo-\nGuna (passion of love and pleasure) is predominant, the person born is Rajo-Guna and intelligent. When the Tamo-Guna (attribute of darkness) is predominant, the  \nperson born is stupid. When at the time of birth all the Grahas are of equal dominance, the person has a mixture of all the attributes. The persons (creatures) so  \nborn are classified, as Uttama (most excellent), Madhyama (of intermediate type), Adhama (despisable) and Udaseena (indifferent, or neutral) in that order. Thus  \nthere are four kinds of animate beings (Prani). I will relate their attributes, which have been described by Narada and other sages. 5. The natural attributes of  \npersons, belonging to Uttam class, are possession of control over organs of perception and mind, simplicity, truthfulness, patience and satisfaction. 6. Valour,  \nsplendour, patience, cleverness, not retreating in war and protecting the holy men are the natural attributes of persons, belonging to Rajo-Guna. 7. Greed,  \nfalsehood, idiocy, laziness and doing service of others are the inborn attributes of persons, who belong to Adham class. 8. Engagement in agriculture and business,  \nprotection of cattle and speaking both truth and lies are inborn attributes of persons, belonging to Udaseena class. 9. O Maitreya! Classify the people, as Uttama,  \nMadhyama, Adhama and Udaseena after observation of the attributes, described above. A person should be considered appropriate for a job, according to his  \nattributes. 10. If amongst Sattva, Rajas and Tamas any attribute is the most dominant, it is considered the most predominant of all. Otherwise all have equal effects.  \n11. The affectionate relationship between an employer and employee and man and women will be invariable and stable, if they possess the same attributes. 12. O  \nMaitreya! Amongst the above four classes of persons, if there is any kind of relationship of even Adhama with Udaseena, of Udaseena with Madhyama and of  \nMadhyama with Uttama, there will be mutual affection and happiness. 13. If the bridegroom has better attributes than the bride and the master has better attributes  \nthan the servant, there will be mutual affection (regard for each other) and happiness. If the bride, or the servant possesses better attributes, the relationships will  \nbe full of bitterness. 14. The attributes of the native are dependent on his father and mother, his time of birth and the persons, he gets associated with. These are  \nthe root causes of Uttama etc. qualities, possessed by him. The attributes, endowed by the time of the birth and associations, are stronger than those, received  \nfrom the parents. 15. Consequently the person is embellished with the attribute Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas, whichever is predominant at the time of birth. The  \npredictions should therefore be made after taking into account the time of birth. 16.

He is the Creator, Protector and Destroyer of all movable and immovable. 17. These three faculties of Lord Kal are called nature. Divided by these faculties,  \nthe imperceptible Lord Kal is also perceptible. 18. In accordance with the self-created qualities by the Perceptible form of Lord Kal, there are four kinds of limbs,  \nnamely Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama. 19. From the Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena and Adhama parts are created Uttama, Madhyama, Udaseena  \nand Adhama types of creatures. 20. The Uttama part of Lord Kal is the head, Madhyama part both arms and chest, thighs form the Udaseena part and the feet fall  \nin the Adhama part. 21. This is how a differentiation is made between classes of movables and immovables, according to attributes and the parts, from which the  \ncreations are made. 22. The Chaturvidha (four sided) Lord Kal has thus created this Chaturvidha universe in consonance with his own attributes. \n \nCh. 78. Lost Horoscopy \n \n1-2. Maitreya said. O Sage! You have so far described the auspicious and inauspicious effects to be enjoyed, or suffered by a person on the basis of the time of  \nbirth, but can the auspicious and inauspicious be ascertained, when the time of birth is not known? Kindly tell me, if there is any way to solve this problem. 3-4. The  \nSage said. Your question is a good one and is for the benefit of the world at large. Considering your attachment, I will tell you about this problem also. If any, or all  \namongst the Samvatsar, Ayana, Ritu, month, Paksha, Tithi, Nakshatr, Lagn, Rashi, or Amsas etc. of the birth are not known, these can be ascertained from Prasna  \nLagn (Query chart). 5-6. The Samvatsar of the birth of the querist will be the same, as that of the Rashi in the Dwadasams, in which the Prasna Lagn falls (Guru will  \nbe in that Rashi at birth). Saumyayan (Uttarayan - the northern course of Surya) will be in the first Hora of Lagn and Yamyayan (Dakshinayan - the southern course  \nof Surya) will be in its second Hora. The Ritu (season) may be determined with reference to the Lord of the Drekkan, in which Lagn falls. Shishir will be indicated by  \nthe Drekkan of Sani, Grishma by that of Surya and Mangal, Vasanta by that of Sukr, Varsha by that of Candr, Sharad by that of Budh and Hemanta by that of Guru.  \n7. If there be any contradiction in the Ayana and Ritu, the Ritu may be determined from Budh in place of Mangal, from Sukr in place of Candr and from Sani in place  \nof Guru. 8-9. After the Ritu becomes known take the first part of the Drekkan, as its first month and latter part, as the next month of the Ritu. Then from the expired  \nAmsas of the Drekkan determine proportionately the Tithi, or the Amsas of Surya. The Istakal, indicated by the Amsas (degrees) of Surya, will be the time of the  \nbirth of the querist. From the Istakal so calculated have to be worked out the longitudes of the Grahas and Bhavas (Grah Spast and Bhava Spast). Predictions  \nshould then be made in accordance with the dispositions of the Bhavas and Grahas. 10. Maitreya asked. O Sage! Guru returns to the same Rashi after every 12  \nyears. Then from which circle of Guru should Samvatsar be determined. 11-12. The Sage said in reply.

The Sage said in reply. O Maitreya! When there is any doubt about the Samvatsar,  \ntake the approximate age of the querist and add multiples of 12 to the difference between the Rashi of the Guru at the time of query and his Rashi at the time of  \nbirth. The figure so arrived at should be taken, as the possible number of years and the Samvatsar should be determined accordingly. If by adding 12 there may  \nappear to be difference in age, the position of Guru should be fixed, according to guessed approximate age, in the Trikon Rashi, 5th, or 9th of the Prasna Lagn, as  \nmay be found feasible. Then, taking that, as the Samvatsar, the Ayana, Ritu etc. should be worked out accordingly in the manner already explained. 13. Maitreya  \nasked again. O Sage! How will the time of birth be known after ascertaining the month and the Amsas etc. of Surya. Please explain this for the benefit of the  \npeople. 14-16.The Sage said. After ascertaining the Rashi, Amsas etc. of Surya at the time of birth, the longitude of Surya (Surya Spast) should be worked out for  \nthe next day after the number of days, taken by Surya after entering into the Rashi, which will be equal to the expired Amsas of Surya. Then the difference between  \nthe longitudes of this rising Surya and Surya at the time of birth should be converted into Kalas and multiplied by 60. The product should be divided by Surya Spast,  \nconverted into Kalas. The Ghatikas etc. so becoming available will represent the Istakal of the birth before and after sunrise. If the longitude of the Ista Surya be  \nmore than that of the rising Surya, the Istakal of the birth will be so much after the sunrise. If the longitude of the Ista Surya be less than that of the rising Surya, the  \nIstakal of the birth will be so much before the sunrise. \n \nCh. 79. Ascetism Yogas \n \n1. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I will describe to you the Yogas, leading to ascetism, under the influence of which the persons give up their homes and become  \ninitiated in some holy order. 2-3. The Yog for ascetism is formed, when four, or more Grahas, possessed of strength, occupy a single Bhava.

If the strongest Grah be conquered in planetary war by another Grah, or Grahas at the time of birth, the person will relinquish that stage of  \nascetic life and review to his previous condition of life.\u201d A Vanaprastha is a religious man, engaged in the practice of rigorous and devout penance (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc90a1fd-1d44-4a15-9ae2-8bc3ea74609e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc90a1fd-1d44-4a15-9ae2-8bc3ea74609e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "467215b8-e1f1-42a1-a4b6-29336bb32798", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "bcb49ad7a8fa4e489eac19cfd47f0529d70d8b1e6b1712fec6d8f30b65bd3f15"}, "2": {"node_id": "968c70e9-fc6c-48cb-bb56-54a14492d648", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b4e4c243b87966c534aa614e3349664e1a42689c3498a54c2696cc28e80e8400"}, "3": {"node_id": "d33d4817-b524-49ee-9718-28ae360439f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "92f478b6170227bc1bf926bad0c1efa6fd4b8cfd30310eb2eea49a13abdf9022"}}, "hash": "a7c5ed33d37e0c9e0118e7ceee7de548c98668c75fe085f4576f8397a52f344f", "text": "he will be a  \nTapasvi); a Vivas is a naked ascetic (that is dwelling in hills and forests).

Notes. Brihat Jatak adds in this connection, that, if the Grahas referred to above be overcome in planetary war and be aspected by other Grahas,  \nthe person concerned will seek admission into the holy order without success. 5. If the other Grahas lose their strength (in spite of being in their exaltation Rashis  \netc.), as a result of combustion with Surya, the native will enter the holy order, as signified by Surya, that is, he will become a Tapasvi. 6. If the Lord of the Rashi,  \noccupied by Candr (Janm Rashi), having no aspect of other Grahas on himself, aspects Sani, the native gets initiated into the holy order of the Grah, who is  \nstronger amongst the two. 7. If the Lord of the Rashi, occupied by Candr, be devoid of strength and is aspected only by Sani, the native becomes initiated into the  \nholy order, signified by Sani (Nirgranthas, naked ascetics). 8.

There is planetary war, if Mangal, Budh, Guru, Sukr and Sani are together (within one  \ndegree of each other), Sukr is the conquerer, whether he is in North, or South, but amongst the other four only one, who is in the North, is the conquerer and that in  \nthe South is considered defeated in the planetary war. 10. If the Grah, who leads the native to ascetism, is conquered in planetary war by another Grah, or Grahas  \nat the time of birth, the person will relinquish the holy order, in which he becomes initiated. 11. Maitreya asked. O Venerable Sage! If there be many Grahas, who  \nare significators for ascetism, then, which holy order the native will get initiated into? 12. Maharishi Parasara replied. O Brahmin! If all the Grahas be possessed of  \nstrength, the native enters into the holy orders of all the Grahas. 13. The native gets initiated into the holy order of the Grah, whose Dasa gets into operation at first.  \nThen he relinquishes this holy order of this Grah at the commencement of the Dasa of the next Grah and accepts the holy order, signified by him. 14. When Guru,  \nCandr and Lagn are aspected by Sani and Guru occupies the 9th, the person, born in the Rajayog, will become a holy illustrious founder of a system of philosophy  \n(holy order). 15. When Sani occupies the 9th from Lagn and is not aspected by any Grah, the person, possessed of Rajayog, will take himself to the holy order,  \nbefore becoming a Lord of men.

The good and evil, affecting their person, should be calculated from Candr and Lagn, whichever of them is stronger. It is from  \nthe 7th Bhava from Lagn, or Candr, that all, that is worthy, or unworthy in the husband should be ascertained and the death of the husband is foretold through the  \n8th. All this should be well weighed by the strength, or weakness of the Grahas, benefic and malefic. Before an announcement is made, of Lagn and Candr find,  \nwhich is stronger.

Day of birth Sunday, Nakshatr  \nAslesha, 2nd Tithi; Saturday, Krittika, 7th Tithi; Tuesday, Satabhisha, 12th Tithi. 44. The woman will be Visha Kanya, if at birth Lagn be occupied by a malefic and a  \nbenefic and two Grahas be in inimical Rashis. 45. Visha Kanya gives birth to a child already dead. She has a defective generative organ and is bereft of robes,  \nornaments etc. 46. The evil effects of Visha Kanya are destroyed, if the Lord of the 7th is a benefic, or a benefic Grah be in the 7th from Lagn, or Candr. 47. The  \nwoman born becomes a widow, if Mangal be in the 12th, 4th, 7th, or 8th from Lagn, without aspect by, or association with any benefic. 48-49. The Yog, which  \ncauses the woman to become widow also causes a male native to become a widower. If the man and woman, possessing this Yog, join in wedlock, the Yog ceases  \nto have any effect. 50-51. If at a woman\u2019s birth the rising Rashi be that of Sukr and the rising Navams be of Sani (Kumbh, according to Brihat Jatak) and, if Sukr  \nand Sani aspect each other, or are occupying each other\u2019s Navams, she will be afflicted with too much lust and will allay her fire of passion with the help of other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f170706-d67b-471d-96cd-2aab1e68263b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f170706-d67b-471d-96cd-2aab1e68263b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6c73d3c-9aad-4736-ba99-94e4276d2eda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b2a5fb343798caafd4d3013eeb409542c403dca99670f65dd23509b6f8bda7d6"}, "3": {"node_id": "01ea54fe-3c10-4f39-9d2b-f4798637bf03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "978ec627e72f601695a21b2ca6d25241b741a3bd1e7d8af77d89680bc214227f"}}, "hash": "6c6654a48d68b387b76b407ef3f69aed2205a0b0256d561332a93d822eea3e5b", "text": "females, acting the part of a male. 52.

Effects of Characteristic Features of Parts of Woman\u2019s body. \n \n1-2. Maitreya said. O Venerable Sage! I have been fully enlightened by the auspicious and inauspicious effects, described by you with reference to the Janm Lagn  \nin a female\u2019s horoscope. Now I request you to favour me with knowledge of auspicious and inauspicious effects with reference to the characteristic features of the  \nvarious parts of a woman\u2019s body. Maharishi Parasara replied. O Brahmin! Now I will tell you what Lord Shiva narrated to Goddess Parvati in this regard. 3-4. A  \nwoman, whose soles are even, smooth, soft, well developed, warm and shining in pink colour, without much perspiration, will be enjoying full happiness, befitting  \nher sex. The one, whose soles are without pink colour, hard, dry, coarse, uneven, shaped, like a winnowing basket and bereft of flesh, will suffer misery. 5-6. The  \nwoman, who has marks of conch, Swastika, Chakr, lotus, flag, fish, umbrella and a long line, rising upwards in her soles, becomes a queen and enjoys great  \nhappiness and comforts. The one, who possesses marks, like those of snake, rat and crow, is bereft of wealth and suffers misery. 7. The girl, whose nails of toes  \nare shining in pink colour, smooth, raised and round, enjoys great happiness and comforts. Blackish and torn nails denotes misery. 8. Raised, full, well developed,  \nsmooth and round great toe indicates happiness. The one, which is small, irregular in shape and flat, denotes misery. 9. The woman\u2019s toes, which are soft, thick,  \nround and well developed are considered auspicious. If the toes are long, she will be of loose morals. Thin toes indicate poverty. 10-16. Other effects about the toes  \nare, as under. Short - short life. Short and long and irregular in shape - procurer and guileful. Flat - maid-servant. Spaced more than average - bereft of wealth.  \nToes, overlapping one over the other - widow and dependent on others. If dust is thrown up, when she walks - unchaste and brings defame to all the three families  \n(her father\u2019s, mother\u2019s and husband\u2019s). If the smallest toe does not touch the ground - she will destroy her husband and marry another; If the middle toe and the one  \nnext to it does not touch the ground - widow. First toe (next to great toe) longer than the great toe - she will develop illicit connection with a man before marriage  \nand will be of loose morals. 17. If the back of the feet of a woman is raised, without perspiration, soft and smooth, she will become a queen. If the indications are  \ncontrary, she will be poverty-stricken. She will be fond of travelling, if the back part of the feet be veined. Hair on that portion of feet denote, that she will be a maid  \nservant. If the feet be bony, or without flesh, she will have a defective sexual organ. 18. If the heels are even, the woman concerned will have a well formed and  \ndesirable sexual organ.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01ea54fe-3c10-4f39-9d2b-f4798637bf03": {"__data__": {"id_": "01ea54fe-3c10-4f39-9d2b-f4798637bf03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6c73d3c-9aad-4736-ba99-94e4276d2eda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b2a5fb343798caafd4d3013eeb409542c403dca99670f65dd23509b6f8bda7d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f170706-d67b-471d-96cd-2aab1e68263b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "6c6654a48d68b387b76b407ef3f69aed2205a0b0256d561332a93d822eea3e5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "43c05ab7-6ddb-426f-abc0-0238af92f3c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "c240be07250e8e265917e7c66e8738c630b35317ef715634695ad44cb57ba271"}}, "hash": "978ec627e72f601695a21b2ca6d25241b741a3bd1e7d8af77d89680bc214227f", "text": "If the heels be stout, she will have a defective sexual organ. If the heels be high, she will be unchaste. Long heels indicate misery. 19. Legs  \n(portion below knees). Even, smooth, evenly shaped, round, without hair, good looking and without veins showing up are Rashis, that the woman will be a queen.  \n20. Round, smooth, firm knees are auspicious indications. If the knees be bony, the woman concerned will be of loose moral character. If the knees be loose, she  \nwill be poverty-stricken. 21. If the thighs are round, like the trunk of an elephant, close to each other, soft and without hair, the woman concerned will be a queen. If  \nthe thighs are flat and hairy, she will be poverty-stricken and a widow. 22-23. Waist. Circumference equal to the width of 24 fingers with well developed hips  \nindicate, that the woman will be fortunate. A waist, which is flat, long, without flesh, caved in, or hairy, forebodes widowhood and misery. 24. Raised, fleshy and  \nwidespread hips in a woman are auspicious in effects. If they are contrary, they indicate inauspiciousness. 25-27. Sexual organ. Hidden clitoris, pink-coloured,  \ncurved, like the back of a tortoise, soft, hairy, shaped, like the leaf of a Pipal tree and smooth is highly auspicious. If shaped, like the feet of a deer, or opening of an  \noven with hard hair and with raised clitoris, it indicates evil. If the left side of the sexual organ of a woman is raised, she will beget more female children and, if the  \nright side is raised, more boys. If the organ is shaped, like a conch, she will be barren. 28. Portion below the navel. A soft, spread out and slightly raised Vasti is  \nauspicious. Hairy, veins, showing up and full of lines (folds, or wrinkles) indicates inauspiciousness. 29. A navel deep with right turns is productive of good effects.  \nThe navel raised, with left turns and with knots is inauspicious. 30-31. A stomach well spread indicates a well formed sexual organ and many sons. If the stomach  \nof a woman resembles that of a frog, her son will become a king. If a woman has a raised stomach she will be childless. If the stomach is wrinkled, she will become  \nan ascetic. If it has circular folds, she will become a maid-servant. 32. If the portion, covering the ribs, is even, well developed and soft, auspicious effects may be  \nexpected. It will be inauspicious, if it is raised, hairy and full of veins. 33. The chest of a woman, which is even and hairless is auspicious. Wide spread and hairy  \nchest is inauspicious. 34-36. The breasts of a woman signify good luck, if they are of equal size, fleshy, round and firm, but close together. They are unlucky, if they  \nare thick in front, are not close together and without flesh. Raised right breast indicates, that she will have sons. Raised left breast indicates, that she will have  \ndaughters. If the portion, surrounding the nipples, is round, good-looking and blackish, she will enjoy good luck. Pressed in and unusually small breasts indicate bad  \nluck. 37. Shoulders. Even, well built up and without joints showing up are Rashis of good luck. Raised, hairy and without flesh are unlucky. 38. The armpits, if soft,  \nwith thin hair, well developed and smooth are auspicious. Those, which are deep, without flesh, perspiring and with veins, showing up are inauspicious. 39-40.  \nArms, in which the bones do not show up and which are soft jointed, hairless without obvious veins, straight and round are auspicious.

If the backs of the hands of a woman are well built, soft and hairless,  \nshe will enjoy auspicious effects.

She will be the mother of a king, if she has marks of  \nconch, umbrella and tortoise. 48-50. The woman, who has lines, forming the shapes of a balance, elephant, bull, or horse, becomes the wife of a businessman. The  \nwoman, who has lines, forming the shape of a house, or Vajra is lucky and gives birth to a son, who becomes learned in Shastras. The woman, who has lines,  \nforming the shapes of a chariot, a plough, or a yoke, becomes the wife of a farmer. She will become a queen, if she has lines, forming the shape of Chamar,  \nAnkush, trident, sword, mace, Shakti, or trumpet. 51-52. If in the palm of a woman there is a line, which, starting from the root of the thumb goes up to the root of  \nthe little finger, she becomes a widow. If there are lines, forming the shape of a crow, a frog, a jackal, a wolf, a scorpion, a snake, a donkey, a camel and a cat, the  \nwoman concerned suffers misery. 53-54. If the fingers of a woman are tender with good-looking phalanges, tapering at the end and without hair, they are  \nconsidered auspicious. If they are very small, without flesh, irregular, widely spaced, with hair and with more than usual phalanges, or without phalanges, they  \nindicate misery. 55. If the nails of the fingers are pink-coloured, raised and shaped well at the top, they are auspicious. Depressed, dirty-looking, or yellow, or white-\ncoloured nails, or nails with spots are inauspicious. 56. If the back of the woman is fleshy and well developed with flesh, it is auspicious. The back with hair,  \nirregular in built and with veins showing up is inauspicious. 57-58. The neck of a woman with three lines (folds), with bones not obvious, round, well developed and  \ntender is auspicious. A thick necked woman becomes a widow. An irregularly built neck indicates, that the woman concerned will become a maid-servant. Flat  \nnecked woman will be barren. A woman with a small neck is childless. 59. A straight, well developed, somewhat raised throat is auspicious. One without flesh, with  \nveins obvious, with hair and irregular in built is inauspicious. 60. Pink-coloured, tender and firm chin is auspicious. A broad chin with hair and clefts is unlucky. 61.  \nRaised, firm and round cheeks are auspitious.

Head of a woman high and round, like  \nthat of an elephant, is indicative of happiness. A head, which is spread out, flat, big and uneven, indicates misery. 84-85.

Now I will describe to you the effects of moles, marks, spots and signs, found on the body of women and men. 2-3. A mole,  \nspot, or figure, formed by hair on the left side of a woman and right side of a man is auspicious. If there is mole on the chest of a woman, she will be fortunate. A  \nwoman, who has a red mark, like a mole etc., on her right breast, begets many children and she is blessed with all kinds of enjoyments and comforts. 4. The  \nwoman, who has a red mark (mole) on her left breast, begets only one son. 5. The woman, who has a mole on her right breast, begets many daughters and sons.  \n6.

Please tell  \nme, what are the Yogas for such an effect and what are the remedial measures to protect the children? 6. Lord Shiva replied: O Devi! You have asked a very  \nrelevant question. Now I will tell you the Yogas for loss of children and the requisite remedial measures. 7.

I have already described the names and characteristic features and qualities of the Grahas. Joys and sorrows of all the creatures in the world are  \ndependent on these Grahas. Therefore persons desirous of peace, wealth and prosperity, rainfall, good health and longevity should worship the Grahas (by  \nprayers, recitation of Mantras, charity etc.). 3-5.

Therefore they are most venerable. \n \nCh. 85. Inauspicious Births \n \n1-4. The Venerable Sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you the circumstances, in which the births are inauspicious in spite of Lagn and the Grahas being  \nwell disposed. Although Lagn may be well disposed, births will be inauspicious, if they take place on Amavasya (last day of the Krishna Paksha), on Chaturdasi  \n(14th Tithi), in Krishna Paksha (dark half of the month), in Bhadra Karan, in the Nakshatr of the brother, in the Nakshatras of father and mother, at the time of entry  \nof Surya in a Rashi, the time of Pata, at the time of solar and lunar eclipses, at the time of Vyati Pata, in Gandantas of all the three kinds, in Yamaghant,  \nTithikshaya, in Dagdha Yog etc. The birth of a son after three daughters and birth of a daughter after three sons and the birth of a freak are inauspicious. But there  \nare remedial measures for obtaining relief from the evil effects of such births, which are being described in the following chapters. \n \nCh. 86. Remedies for Amavasya Birth \n \n1-9. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya! The person, born on Amavasya, is always poverty stricken. It is therefore essential to adopt remedial measures to obtain  \nrelief from the evil effects of such births, which are, as follows. Take a Kalash (water vessel) and then put in it fresh leaves of Goolar (wild fig), Vata (banyan), Pipal,  \nmango and Neema (mango) trees and cover it with two pieces of cloth. Then install the Kalash in the South-West direction after reciting \u2026 etc. and \u2026 etc. Mantras.  \nThen worship the idols of Surya and Candr, ruling deities of Amavasya, made of gold and silver, mixed with copper, respectively, by recitation of \u2026 etc. Mantras for  \nSurya and \u2026 etc. Mantras for Candr 16, or 5 times. Thereafter perform Havan with 108, or 28 oblations of the mixture of prescribed fuels (\u2026) and cooked food  \n(Charu) with recitation of Mantras of Surya and Candr. Later sprinkle the water on the child, that is born and his parents and offer in charity gold, silver and a black  \ncow together with feeding the Brahmins, according to one\u2019s means. By performing these remedial rites the child born gains freedom and protection from the evil  \neffects of the birth on Amavasya \n \nCh. 87. Remedies from Birth on Krishna Chaturdashi \n \n1-3. The Sage said. Divide the span of Chaturdashi in 6 parts. The birth in the first part is auspicious. Second part causes destruction, or death of father. Third part  \ncauses death of the mother. Fourth part takes away the maternal uncle. Fifth part destroys the entire family (Khula - generation). Sixth part causes loss of wealth, or  \ndestruction (death) of the native. Therefore it is essential to take immediate remedial measures to escape these evil effects. 4-5. Have an idol of Lord Shiva, made  \nof one Karsha (equal in weight to the former silver Rupee) of gold, or of weight one can afford.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96fa504-f4e3-4bde-87bc-d2c51bda83da": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96fa504-f4e3-4bde-87bc-d2c51bda83da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1880aee7-ea0d-4eab-b089-a720a6897983", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "2342b8839097666d065896b8b692b0e7a7cf1bf62d3c4699e5370cbcb0fcb662"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2084696-2fa6-45ab-8814-93900822506f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "62878fd6c9643032aa1b54ec575bf5faa5a113a7d43ca2594b139253bb0625bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ae0b671-57f5-4cde-89ee-45729dcd2e99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "187d08ed7c49b5e0de9037c221878093534c8ef8fc5c440cd8017f66daf27c81"}}, "hash": "b567cc916391073df73dbec97eb1bb895f5f72a0cbd2535478e5825d0db9c25f", "text": "The idol should have a New Moon on the forehead, have a white  \ngarland round the neck, have three eyes (one being on the forehead), be dressed in white robes, be seated on a bull, be two-armed and carry Vara and Abhaya. 6-\n13. Then after invocation with Varun Mantra worship should be performed by chanting \u2026 etc. Mantras. Thereafter a Kalash should be placed in the North-East  \ndirection with chanting of \u2018Imah Mai Varun\u2019, \u2018Tan Tva Yami\u2019, \u2018Tvan Nai Agni\u2019 Mantras, followed by Japa of \u2026 etc. and \u2018Bhadra Agni \u2026\u2019 Suktas and the chanting of \u2026  \nMantra. Then, after sprinkling water over the idol of Lord Shiva (Abhisheka), the nine Grahas should be worshipped. This should be followed by Havan, by using  \nGhi, powder of sesame seeds, Urda, Sarson and wood pieces of Pipal, Pakar, Palas and Khadir trees. 108, or 28 oblations should be made separately for the nine  \nGrahas. Thereafter, along with chanting of \u2026 etc. Mantras, Havan should be performed with sesame seeds for the nine Grahas. Lastly the water of the Kalash  \nshould be sprinkled on the native and his parents and the Brahmins should be fed, according to means. \n \nCh. 88. Remedies from Birth in Bhadra and Inauspicious Yogas \n \n1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! Now I am going to describe the remedial measures for relief from the evil effects of birth in Bhadra, Tithi Kshaya, Vyatipata,  \nParidha, Vajra etc. inauspicious Yogas and Yamaghants etc. The remedial rites should be performed on the day, when the same inauspicious Yog operates again.  \n3-5. The remedial rites are to be performed in the following order by the parents of the child in the above inauspicious Yogas. Puja of Lord Vishnu and other deities  \non an auspicious day and auspicious Lagn on the advice of a proficient Jyotishi, burning of Deep with Ghi in a Shiva temple, Abhisheka of Lord Shiva, going round  \na Pipal tree 108 times prolongs longevity and perform Havan with 108 oblations along with the recital of \u2018Vaisneh Raratmachityadhi\u2019 Mantra of Lord Vishnu and  \nfeeding Brahmins to the best of one\u2019s means. The observance of these remedial measures will give deliverance to the native from all the evil effects of his  \ninauspicious birth and he will enjoy happiness. \n \nCh. 89. Remedies from Nakshatr Birth \n \n1-7. The Sage Parasara said. O Maitreya! If the birth takes place in the Nakshatras of the brother and the parents, death takes place, without doubt, of the brother  \nand the father, or mother, or they have to undergo death-like suffering. Therefore I am going to describe the remedial measures to be adopted to escape from these  \nevil effects. The remedial rites should be performed in a Muhurta, when Candr and stars are favourable on a day, on which there is no Rikta-Bhadra Dosha. The  \nremedial rites should be performed in the following order. Instal an idol of the Janm Nakshatr on a Kalash in the North-East direction from the fire. Cover it with a  \nred piece of cloth and then warp two pieces of cloth round it. Worship the idol by chanting the Mantras of the Janm Nakshatr. According to one\u2019s Gotra, perform  \nHavan 108 times with the recitation of the same Mantra, facing the fire, with Ghi and other Havan material. Then the priest, performing the Puja, should sprinkle  \nwater on the parents and brother (whoever is concerned).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ae0b671-57f5-4cde-89ee-45729dcd2e99": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ae0b671-57f5-4cde-89ee-45729dcd2e99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1880aee7-ea0d-4eab-b089-a720a6897983", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "2342b8839097666d065896b8b692b0e7a7cf1bf62d3c4699e5370cbcb0fcb662"}, "2": {"node_id": "a96fa504-f4e3-4bde-87bc-d2c51bda83da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "b567cc916391073df73dbec97eb1bb895f5f72a0cbd2535478e5825d0db9c25f"}}, "hash": "187d08ed7c49b5e0de9037c221878093534c8ef8fc5c440cd8017f66daf27c81", "text": "Give presents in cash (Dakshena) to the priest and his colleagues, associated with the ceremony, to the  \nbest of one\u2019s means and then feed the Brahmins to the best of one\u2019s means. \n \nCh. 90. Remedies from Sankranti Birth \n \n1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! The names of the Sankranti on the seven days of the week, beginning from Sunday, are Ghora, Dhavankshi, Mahodari, Manda,  \nMandakini, Mishra and Rakshasi. The person, born at the Sankranti (entry of Surya in a new Rashi), is poor and unhappy, but he becomes well-to-do and happy, if  \nremedial measures are undertaken. I am now going to describe the remedial measures to nullify these evil effects. 3-6. The Yagya of the nine Grahas should be  \nperformed to obtain relief from the evil effects of the birth at Sankranti. A clean spot in the eastern part of the house should be purified by besmearing with cow  \ndung. Then prepare three separate heaps of the following: 5 Dronas (80 Seers) of paddy (Sadhi), 2\u00bd Dronas (40 Seers) of rice, 1\u00bc Dronas (20 Seers) of sesame  \nseeds (Til). On these heaps of grains make a figure of lotus with eight leaves (Ashtamdhal) and then decorate them with flowers. After doing this, select and invite a  \npriest, who is well versed in the performance of religious rites and recitation of Mantras. 7-18. The religious rites are then to be performed in the following order.  \nInstall Kalashas without any holes on all the three heaps and put in each of them water from holy places, Saptamrattika, Shataushadhi, Panchapallava and  \nPanchagavya. Then wrap the Kalashas with pieces of cloth. Place small earthen pots, wrapped with thin cloth, on the Kalashas. Then install the idol of Sankranti  \nalong with the idol of Adhideva and Pratyadhideva. (Here Surya is Adhideva and Candr Pratyadhideva). Their idols should be placed on either side of the main idols  \nof Sankranti. Two robes may be given, as offering to each of the idols. Perform worship of all the three idols, according to the prescribed procedure.

The Sage said. O Brahmin! A person, whose birth takes place at the time of solar, or lunar eclipse, suffers from ailments, distress and poverty and faces  \ndanger of death. Therefore I am going to describe for the benefit of the mankind the remedial measures, required to be undertaken to nullify the above evil effects.  \nThe remedial rites are to be performed in the following order. The following idols should be got prepared, according to one\u2019s means: in gold an idol of the deity of  \nthe Nakshatr, in which the eclipse takes place (regarding deities of Nakshatras, see \u2018notes\u2019 of verse 18, Ch. 3, Vol. I); in gold an idol of Surya, if the birth takes place  \nduring solar eclipse; in silver an idol of Candr, if the birth takes place during lunar eclipse; in lead an idol of Rahu. Besmear a clean spot on the ground (in the  \nhouse) with cow dung, cover it with a new (unused) beautiful piece of cloth and install the three idols on it. Make offerings of the following to the idols: in case of  \nbirth during solar eclipse all things dear to Surya and red-coloured Akshat (Akshata - rice), red sandal, a garland of red-coloured flowers, red clothes etc.; in case of  \nbirth during a lunar eclipse all things dear to Candr and white sandal, white flowers, white clothes etc.; for Rahu blackish clothes, blackish flowers etc.; white flowers  \nfor the deity of the Nakshatr, in which the eclipse takes place. The worship should be performed, as follows: of Surya with the chanting of \u2018Akrishnim\u2019 etc. Mantra; of  \nCandr with the chanting of \u2018Imadeva\u2019 etc. Mantra; of Rahu with Durva (a kind of grass) and with the chanting of \u2018Kayanshicatra\u2019 etc. Mantra. Thereafter Havan  \nshould be performed, as follows: with the fuel of Aak wood pieces for Surya; with the fuel of Palas tree wood pieces for Candr; with Durva for Rahu; with Pipal tree  \nwood pieces for the deity of the Nakshatr. Sprinkle the holy water of the Kalash on the child born (and his parents). Offer worshipful regards to the priest,  \nperforming the remedial rites and lastly feed as many Brahmins, as possible within one\u2019s means. By performance of the remedial rites in the manner described  \nabove, evil effects of the inauspicious birth are wiped and the native enjoys happiness and is blessed with good fortune. \n \nCh. 92.

The Sage said. O Brahmin! Gandanta is of three kinds, namely of Tithi, Nakshatr and Lagn. Birth, travelling and performance of auspicious functions, like  \nmarriage etc., during Gandanta are likely to cause death of the person concerned. 2. O Maitreya! The last 2 Ghatikas of Purna Tithi (5th, 10th, 15th) and the first 2  \nGhatikas of Nanda Tithi (1st, 6th, 11th) are known, as Tithi Gandanta. 3. Similarly the last two Ghatikas of Revati and first two Ghatikas of Ashvini, the last two  \nGhatikas of Aslesha and first two Ghatikas of Magha and the last two Ghatikas of Jyeshtha and first two Ghatikas of Mula are known, as Nakshatr Gandanta. 4.  \nThe last half Ghatika of Meen and first half Ghatika of Mesh, the last half Ghatika of Kark and first half Ghatika of Simh, the last half Ghatika of Vrischik and first half  \nGhatika of Dhanu are known, as Lagn Gandanta. 5. Amongst these Gandantas the last 6 Ghatikas of Jyeshtha and first 8 Ghatikas of Mula are known, as Abhukta  \nMula. 6-8. Now I will tell you the remedial measures to be adopted to release the child, born during Gandanta, from its evil effects. The father should see the child  \nborn only on the morning next to the end of the days of Sutaka, or on any auspicious day after the performance of the remedial measures. The remedial measures  \nare giving a bullock in charity in the case of Tithi Gandanta, giving a cow with calf in charity in the case of Nakshatr Gandanta, giving gold in charity in the case of  \nLagn Gandanta, performing Abhisheka of the child along with father, if the birth is in the first part of Gandanta and along with mother, if the birth is in the second  \npart of Gandanta. 9-11. Performance of Puja on the holy Kalash of the idol of the deities of Tithi (in case of Tithi Gandanta), Nakshatr (in case of Nakshatr  \nGandanta) and Lagn (in case of Lagn Gandanta), made of 16 Masas, 8 Masas, or 4 Masas of gold, as may be possible, followed by Havan and Abhisheka,  \naccording to procedure already described earlier. At the end as many Brahmins, as may be possible within one\u2019s means, should be fed. These remedial measures  \nwill ensure long life, good health and prosperity for the child. Notes. Unless one is himself fully conversant with the performance of religious rites, the remedies,  \nrecommended in this chapter, earlier and later chapters, should be got performed by and under the directions of a learned priest, because the full effects will be  \nderived, if the rites are performed correctly and according to the procedure, prescribed in the religious scriptures on this subject. \n \nCh. 93. Remedies for Abhukta Mula Birth \n \n1-2. The Sage Parasara said. The ruling deity of Jyeshtha is Indra and the ruling deity of Mula is Rakshasa. As both the deities are inimical to each other, this  \nGandanta is considered, as the most evil. A boy, or girl, born during the period of Abhukta Mula, should either be abandoned, or the father should not see the face  \nof the child for 8 years. Now I shall describe the remedial measures to obtain deliverence from the evil effects of birth during this extremely inauspicious period. 3-4.  \nIn view of the extremely inauspicious effects of birth during Abhukta I shall first describe the remedial measures to obtain relief from Mula.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e6961ef-b947-4c0d-a1ea-509b6c66447d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e6961ef-b947-4c0d-a1ea-509b6c66447d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3fcfe5d9-d723-4afd-9407-4593a6e51070", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "e49c84e9bfe1ecb7ec446f0618843c1fde13fcc4ef60ea0ffe5b0368fe235007"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8bf77a5-b104-4800-ba2f-0dc961369b0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "BrihatParasaraHora.pdf"}, "hash": "032de6ac32012d419356ba5c5393f1b5e7fe1bb5ba6b39bc6047606be10dc59c"}}, "hash": "d842d7fa727c10aa7bd9bdc05782421cbfb8fcfe082dca47eb29928c19a2415f", "text": "The religious remedial  \nrites should be performed after the 12th day after the birth, the next Janm Nakshatr day, or on an auspicious day, when Candr and the stars are favourable. 5-8.  \nErect a canopy (Mandap) with four arched gateways, embellished with festoons, on a sacred spot, besmeared with cow dung paste, to the East, or North of the  \nhouse. Prepare there a pit (Kund), or place there a square vessel of clay, or metal for performing Havan. Then, according to one\u2019s means, prepare, or get prepared  \nan idol of Rakshasa of 16, 8, or 4 Masas of gold, as may be possible within one\u2019s means. The idol should be with a horrible-looking face, black in colour, with two  \nheads, two arms, carrying a sword and a shield and seated on a dead body. 9. In the absence of an idol a piece of gold of the weight, mentioned above, should be  \nused for worship, as gold is dear to all the deities. 10-20. Thereafter the remedial rites should be performed in the following order. Select a learned priest to perform  \nthe religious rites, according to the prescribed procedure. Install a Kalash and put in it Panchagavya (five articles, yielded by a cow, namely milk, curd, Ghi, dung  \nand urine), Shataushadhi and water of the holy river (Ganga etc.). Then install the idol of the Rakshasa of Mula, facing West, on an earthen pot (Dhata) with one  \nhundred tiny holes. After placing bamboo leaves on it, perform the worship of the idol by offering it white flowers, sandal and clothes etc. Also perform worship of its  \nAdhideva Indra and Pratyadhideva Jal. Then perform Havan to appease the deities. According to one\u2019s means, 1008, or 108 oblations should be offered in the  \nHavan. After this to obtain deliverence from death Mrityunjaya Mantra etc. should be recited and prayers offered to all the deities for the purpose of Abhisheka. The  \nfather, mother and the child should thereafter take bath from the water of the two Kalashas. Then the parents, dressed in white clothes and with white sandal paste,  \nbesmeared on their foreheads, should give a cow with calf, as a Dakshina to the chief priest and feed the other priests and Brahmins, according to one\u2019s means.  \nLastly, after reciting the \u2018Yatapapan\u2019 etc. (see verse 19) Mantra, the father, mother and the child should see the reflection of their faces in the (melted) Ghi. By the  \nperformance of the remedial rites in the manner described all evil effects of the birth during Abhukta Mula are completely wiped out. \n \nCh. 94. Remedies from Jyeshtha Gandanta Birth \n \n1-5. The Sage said. O Maitreya! Now I will describe to you the remedial measures to be adopted to ensure relief from the evil effects of Jyeshtha Gandanta. The  \nerection of a canopy (Mandhup), installation of Kalash, selection of a priest etc. will be done in the same manner, as has been recommended for the Abhukta Mula  \nin the previous chapter. In this ceremony Indra will be the deity-in-chief, Adhideva will be Agni and the Pratyadhideva will be Rakshasa. 6. Then the remedial rites  \nshould be performed in the following order. Install on a Kalash, full of paddy rice, an idol of gold with Indra, seated on Airavat with Vajra Ankusha in his hands.  \nPerform worship of the chief deity Indra along with that of the Adhideva and the Pratyadhideva with the recitation of their appropriate Mantras.

In case the performance of remedial rites, described above, is beyond the means  \nof any person, he should give a cow in charity. This will also appease the deities and promote relief from the evil effects of the Gandanta. Because the giving of a  \ncow in charity has been considered a superior remedial measure than giving in charity all the lands, belonging to a person. 8-9. According to prescribed remedial  \nmeasures, 3 cows are to be given in charity in the case of Jyeshtha-Mula and Aslesha-Magha Gandantas, 2 cows in Revati-Ashvini Gandantas and 1 cow in other  \nGandantas, or in any inauspicious Yog. If cow, or cows are not available, their actual value should be given in cash to a Brahmin. 10. A girl, born in Jyeshtha  \nNakshatr, destroys (is the cause of death of) the elder brother of her husband and a girl, born in fourth quarter of Vishaka Nakshatr, destroys her husband\u2019s  \nyounger brother. Therefore a cow should be given in charity at the time of the marriage of such girls to wipe out the above-mentioned evil effects. 11-13. A boy, or  \ngirl, born in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th quarter of Aslesha Nakshatr, destroys his/her mother-in-law and a boy, or a girl, born in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd quarter of Mula Nakshatr,  \nbecomes the destroyer of his/her father-in-law. Therefore suitable measures, as may be possible within one\u2019s means, should be taken at the time of the marriage of  \nsuch boys and girls. There will be no evil effect, if the husband has no elder brothers. \n \nCh. 95. Remedies from Birth of a Daughter after Three Sons \n \n1-2. The Sage said. O Brahmin! I will now tell you about other kinds of inauspicious births. The birth of a daughter after the birth of three sons, or the birth of a son  \nafter the birth of three daughters is ominous for both the maternal and paternal families of such children. Therefore remedial measures, described below, may be  \ntaken to get deliverance from these evil effects. 3-9. The rites should be performed on the morning next to the last day of Sutak, or on any other auspicious day in  \nthe following order. After selecting a priest and some Brahmins to perform the remedial religious rites, the priest, after paying obeisance to the nine Grahas, should  \ninstall four Kalashas on a heap of paddy, place the idols of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha and Indra, made of gold, on them and perform their worship in the prescribed  \nmanner. A Brahmin (an assistant of the priest), after taking bath etc., should recite four Rudra Suktas and the whole of Shanti Sukta. The priest should perform  \nHavan with Samidha, Ghi and sesame seeds 1008, 108, or 28 times with the recitation of the prescribed Mantras of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha and Indra.  \nSvistkrata and Purnahuti and Abhisheka of the child with his family should be done and presents in cash should be given to the priest and his assistants, according  \nto one\u2019s means. The Brahmins should be fed. The father and the mother of the child should see their reflections in the Ghi, kept in a bronze vessel. Lastly grains  \nand clothes should be distributed to the poor and the needy. By the performance of the above remedial rites the evil effects are wiped out and the child and his  \nparents etc. enjoy happiness. \n \nCh. 96. Remedies from Unusual Delivery \n \n1-3.

O Brahmin! I will now tell you about inauspicious and unusual deliveries by women, which are ominous for the village, town and the country.  \nThese may be of the following kinds. Delivery of a child 2, 3, or 4 months earlier, or later from the approximate due date. Delivery of a child without hands, feet, or  \nany other limbs, without head, or with two heads. Delivery of an animal-shaped being by a woman, or a human-shaped being by an animal. 4-5. Deliveries of these  \nkinds by women, or cows etc. in a house are ominous for all the members of the family, living there. Therefore remedial measures are essential for obtaining relief  \nfrom their evil effects. The best remedial measure will be to abandon (turn out from the Bhava) such women and animals (cows, mares etc.). 6-9. It is considered  \ninauspicious for a girl to become pregnant, or to deliver a child in her 15th, or 16th year from birth. If a cow delivers, when Surya is in Simh, or a female buffalo  \ndelivers, when Surya is in Makar, they are disasterous to their owner and the person, who looks after them. Therefore either such cow, or buffalo should be given  \naway to a Brahmin, or suitable remedial measures should be taken to escape from the above-mentioned evil effects. The remedial measures to be adopted are the  \nsame, as given in verses 3-9 in Ch. 95. 10. Thus, whenever there is any kind of Aristha, adoption of appropriate remedial measures will ensure long life, happiness  \nand prosperity for the person concerned. \n \nCh. 97. Conclusion \n \n1-4. Maharishi Parasara said. O Brahmin! I have described to you the Jyotish Shastra, as narrated by Lord Brahma to the Sage Narada and by Narada to  \nShaunaka and other Sages, from whom I received the knowledge of this Shastra. I have narrated the same Jyotish Shastra, which I learnt from them. Do not impart  \nthe knowledge of this Shastra to one, who is insignificative, slanders, or calumniates others, nor to one, who is not intelligent, is wicked and unknown to you. Teach  \nthis supreme Vedanga Jyotish Shastra only to one, who is gentle and amiable, devoted, truthful, brilliant and well known to you. 5-6. Only that person, who  \npossesses adequate knowledge of time and the positions of Grahas and Nakshatras, can understand this Hora Shastra. Only that person, who has complete  \nknowledge of the Hora Sastra and who is truthful, can make correct favourable, or unfavourable predictions. 7. One, who reads, or listens with attention and  \ndevotion to this most excellent Hora Shastra, becomes long-lived and is blessed with increase in his strength, wealth and good reputation. 8-9. Thus was narrated  \nby Maharishi Parasara to Maitreya this novel Horasastra, containing invaluable and uncommon material from ancient scriptures on Jyotish, for the benefit of the  \nworld at large. Afterwards it came into usage on the earth and received reverence from all. 10-25. In these verses have been described the subject matters of all  \nthe chapters, contained in this book and their importance. \n \nOm tat sat", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,
