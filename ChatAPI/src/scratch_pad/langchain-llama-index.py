import langchain
import llama_index

# Create a LangChain client
client = langchain.Client()

# Create a llama-index index
index = llama_index.Index()

# Add data to the index
index.add("document1.txt", "This is the first document.")
index.add("document2.txt", "This is the second document.")

# Create a RAG chain
chain = langchain.Chain()
chain.add_node(langchain.LLMNode(client))
chain.add_node(langchain.LlamaIndexNode(index))

# Run the chain
result = chain.run("What is the second document?")

# Print the result
print(result)
In this example, we create a LangChain client and a llama-index index. We then add some data to the index. Next, we create a RAG chain that consists of an LLM node and a LlamaIndex node. Finally, we run the chain with a query and print the result.
The LLM node in the chain is responsible for generating responses to the user's queries. The LlamaIndex node is responsible for retrieving relevant data from the index and providing it to the LLM node. By combining the capabilities of LangChain and llama-index, we can create a RAG chat app that can answer questions based on both its training data and the data in the index.
