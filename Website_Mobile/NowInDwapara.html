                                    turning on their axes revolve with their moons
                                    round the sun; and the sun, with its planets ancl
                                    their moons, takes some star for its dual and revolves
                                    round it in about 24,000 years of our
                                    earth-a celestial phenomenon which causes the

                                    Kali Yuga. Dharrnaj the mental virtue, is then in its
                                    first stage and is only a quarter developed; the
