		<Name>House 1</Name>

	<Event>
		<Name>House 2</Name>
		<Description>
			The second house signifies, family, speech, vision and
			financial prosperity.The several yogas—good
			and bad—formed by the second lord or in the second house
			will produce their own effects. These considerations hold
			good in the Navamsa also. In short the second house
			largely but not exclusively indicates wealth.

		<Name>House 3</Name>
		<Description>
			The third house rules brothers, sisters and relatives in
			general. It has governance over courage. The third is also
			concerned with throat, ears and father's death. In regard to
			brothers and sisters, the reference is generally to younger
			ones, i.e., those born after the native.

	<Event>
		<Name>House 4</Name>
		<Description>
			The fourth has reference to mother, immovable
			property, education, vehicles and general happiness. It
			follows as a matter of course that an affliction to the fourth
			house may result in the shape of depriving the person of
			peace of mind, causing misfortune to his mother, troubles
			in regard to property affairs and so on. But in reality, a
			person may be educated but may also lose his mother early.
			He may command good immovable properties but may not
			be happy. Of the various yogas present in the horoscope,
			those that have a bearing on the fourth house should be carefully noted.
			We shall first consider the general combinations and
			then the effects of planets severally. The fourth, like the
			tenth, is a very important house and is in fact the pivot
			around which revolve some of the special events affecting
			the individual's life.

		<Name>House 5</Name>
		<Description>
			The fifth house refers to children, emotions and
			feelings, faith in God and past birth good (Poorvapunya).
			To a certain extent it is also concerned with speculative tendencies.
			The remarks made in para 2 of page 159 pertaining to the fourth
			house apply with equal force to the fifth house also.

	<Event>
		<Name>House 6</Name>
		<Description>
			The sixth house rules or signifies accidents, diseases,
			enemies, mental affliction, mother's brother and
			misfortunes. An affliction to the sixth house may result in
			the shape of the person suffering diseases or incurring debts
			or enemies. In reality however a person may be suffering
			from diseases, but be free from debts or he may be
			perfectly healthy but involved in huge debts. The difficulty
			arises in differentiating the different events comprehended
			by a single house.Planets involved in aspect-ing the house
			and the lord are also important. Several arishta yogas
			having a bearing on the sixth house should be carefully
			studied.

			of the 7th house and the planets associating with the 7th lord.

			The 8th House deals with longevity, legacies, gifts and
			unearned wealth, nature of death, disgrace, degradation and
			details pertaining to death.The yogas formed in
			the 8th house will produce their own effects. The same
			considerations must be judged from the Navamsa chart also.
			Although there are several significations to the eighth house, we
			will focus our attention on the source and nature, time and place
			of death.

			grand-children, intuition, religion, sympathy, fame, charities,
			leadership, long journeys and communication with spirits.

			involving the 9th lord produce their own results. These
			considerations must be judged from the Navamsa chart also.
